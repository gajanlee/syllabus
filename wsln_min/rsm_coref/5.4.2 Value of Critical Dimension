Theorem 5.4 only gives the existence of critical dimension, but what is the value of critical dimension? The following theorem will answer this question. 
Theorem 5.5. Given a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and every Xi's coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. Suppose N is the number of points in a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and its coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. and |Xi| is the number of coordinates on axis Xi, and the space dimension n and every |Xi| are all variable. Let n0 be the critical dimension in theorem 5.4, then for any >0, there exists N0, such that if N >N0, then we have . 
Proof. According to the proof of theorem 5.4, we only need to estimate the value of Z. As Z. is the unique zero point of f (x) between 1 and lgN, we have:  
This is a transcendental equation, it is impossible to solve the value of Z accurately, so we will estimate the value of Z Z in the next. We will prove that for any >0, if N is big enough, then we have . Because f (x) is strictly increasing, we only need to show that when N is big enough,   and . It is clear that f (x) =0.5 + lnN>0. When ,  is obvious. When ,  is equivalent to , and because  and  , there exists N1>0, if N > N1, then   and , which means that   and  .  Now we have: 
So we only need to let  < , which is equivalent to  , get the natural logarithm for both sides, we have: 
Because , we have  , then  . So there exists N2, if N > N2, then , i.e.,   holds. If we let N0=Max{N1, N2}, then if N > N0, we have  , i.e.,  . 
Combining above results, we can get that for any >0, there exists N0 such that if N >N0, then  .  
Theorem 5.5 shows that when N is big enough, the critical dimension n0 can approach lnN to any extent. The minimum of f(n) is about:
