A data cube is a type of multidimensional matrix that lets users explore and analyze a collection of data from many perspectives (Agrawal, 1996; Gray, 1996). Data is usually organized in cube form. Cooperation with other tools in statistics or analysis, the data cube can support establishing trends and analyzing performance (Graefe, 1993).  
The following are three major differences between data cube and the Resource Space Model:  
1.	The data cube is used to establish trends and analyze performance, while the Resource Space Model is to specify and manage resources by orthogonal classification semantics;  
2.	The data in a data cube has already been processed and aggregated into cube form, thus data cube is a read-only data model, while the Resource Space Model can deal with dynamic data; and,  
3.	A lot of calculations for view in data cube will be completed before hand, while the operations in the Resource Space Model are real-time. 
A data warehouse is a specifically structured copy of transaction data for query and analysis (Inmon, 2002). The data in a data warehouse is usually organized by certain multidimensional data model. Cooperation with OLAP and data mining, data warehouse can provide decision sup-port for enterprise management.  
The main differences between data warehouse and the Resource Space Model are:  
1.	A data warehouse is mainly used to support decision-making, so A data warehouse attaches more importance to historical, summarized and consolidated data (Kimball, 1996). In contrast, the Resource Space Model focuses mainly on online resource operation.  
2.	Data warehouses are usually not updatable. Since data warehouses are usually used to store historical data for query and analysis, data in data warehouses are read-only. While, the Resource Space Model, targeted at Internet applications, can be frequently operated.  
3.	The application scope of the Resource Space Model is broader than that of data warehouse. The application scope of a data warehouse is usually confined within a certain enterprise, while the Resource Space Model can uniformly specify and manage versatile resources on the whole network. 
The comparison in table 2.1 shows that the integration of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network reserves the advantages of both models.   
The Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network reflect classification semantics and link semantics respectively. The Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network can be transformed to each other under certain conditions. The integration of The Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network can form a single semantic image to support semantic-based resource location. The operations on the union view can keep the normal forms.  Further, The integration of the two models can construct a semantic overlay integrating the normalization and autonomy.
