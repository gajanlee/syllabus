Peer-to-Peer systems are playing more and more important role in re-source sharing fields.  Take scientific research for example, researchers are usually specialized in one area during a period of time and may con-cern other relevant areas.  When there exists a Peer-to-Peer e-science sys-tem supporting researchers in different areas to share resources, intuitive-ly a researcher will communicate with those sharing the same interests more frequently, because a researcher could get the satisfied answers with high probability and save time by avoiding communication with irrelevant peers.  But peers should not be constraint to the community of peers's fields as peers need to communicate with peers in other fields, although not frequently. So classification of peers plays an important role in im-proving the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system.  
An n-dimensional resource space represents n kinds of partition on a set of resources.  A resource space can be mapped into a partition tree (e.g., Fig. 8.1(a) can be mapped into Fig. 8.1(b)). 
The classification semantics of the partition tree can be used to im-prove the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system because a peer could get the satisfied answers with high probability by interacting more frequently with the peers of the same community sharing common interests. Peers also need to communicate with peers of other communities. 
We can make each leaf correspond to the peers in the same category. The communities in the leaves of the partition could change with peers’ joining and departing behaviors. 
The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is a classification hierarchy, which can help scientific activities such as submitting, review-ing, publishing and searching papers. The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is based on the following philos-ophy:  
1.	The core of the CCS is a classification tree to present a hierarchical structure of disciplines and research areas.  
2.	The classification tree is restricted to three levels to accurately reflect the essential structure of the disciplines.  
3.	The uncoded fourth level of the classification tree, subject descriptors, provides sufficient detail to cope with new developments in the field (http://www.acm.org/class/1998/ccs98.html). Taking “Information systems  Database management  Languages  Query languages” for example, the first three levels correspond to the classification hierarchy, and “Query languages” is a subject descriptor.  
The CCS is actually a 1-dimensional classification space. The Resource Space Model supports multi-dimensional classification semantics. Such classification knowledge can be used to improve the query efficiency if we implement a Peer-to-Peer e-science system. Actually, ontology has been used to improve structured Peer-to-Peer systems (Schlosser et al., 2002). 
Incorporating resource space with gossip mechanisms is a way to im-prove the performance of this type of Peer-to-Peer networks and enables the Resource Space Model to support decentralized applications.
