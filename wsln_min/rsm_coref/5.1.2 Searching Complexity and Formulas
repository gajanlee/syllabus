For the type of problems whose inputs are non-deterministic (there are many cases of inputs), such as sorting and searching, generally we con-sider two types of complexity, the worst-case complexity and the average complexity, denoted as W(n) and A(n) respectively, supposing the scale of problem is n.  Suppose the probability of the occurring of every element in the set is the same and the probability of a successful searching is 1, then we have the following conclusions (Baase and Gelder, 2000; Levitin, 2003): 
Lemma 5.1 Searching an element K in a sorted set with n elements, any algorithm (based on the comparison between names) must do at least   comparisons in the worst case. 
Lemma 5.2 Searching an element K in a sorted set with n elements, any algorithm (based on the comparison between names) must do at least   comparisons on average. 
Lemma 5.3 Searching an element K in an unsorted set with n elements, any algorithm (based on the comparison between names) must do at least n comparisons in the worst case. 
Lemma 5.4 Searching an element K in an unsorted set with n elements, any algorithm (based on the comparison between names) must do at least   comparisons on average. 
The above lower bounds are all optimal. For example, the Binary Search algorithm can get the lower bounds in lemma 5.1 and 5.2, the Se-quential Searching algorithm can get the lower bounds in lemma 5.3 and 5.4. 
Here lgn is the base-2 logarithm, logn is the base-10 logarithm, lnn is the natural logarithm, and  is the base-a logarithm.   is the floor of x, is the ceiling of x, and we have: . Specially, for natural number n, we have:  and  (Graham et al., 1989). 
For xi0, 1in, there is a sequence of inequalities (Agarwal, 2000):  
For a function f(x) defined on the real domain, if f (x)>0 or f (x)<0, then f(x) is a concave function (or convex function), f(x) has a unique minimum (or maximum) on the real domain, and we have the fol-lowing formula (Agarwal, 2000):  
A real-valued function f(x) is continuous on interval [a, b] and satisfy-ing f(a)f(b)<0, then there exists a zero point of f(x) in interval [a, b] (Strang, 1991). 
On the increasing order of function, we have: lnlnn< lnn < nc < an (a>1, c>0), and for any  >0, we have:
