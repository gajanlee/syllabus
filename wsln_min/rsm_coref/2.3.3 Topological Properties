Just as the quotient resource space defined in (Zhuge et al., 2005c), the quotient Semantic Link Network is the abstract of the original Semantic Link Network, and the quotient Semantic Link Network reflects the higher level semantics. Here we will prove that the quotient Semantic Link Network keeps the three normal forms of the original Semantic Link Network, which shows that the quotient Semantic Link Network is a “good” Semantic Link Network. 
Definition 2.3. For a Semantic Link Network SLN (N, SL), if there exists an equivalent relation R on the set of nodes N (SLN), then the quotient Semantic Link Network of a Semantic Link Network SLN (N, SL) is defined as SLN (N , SL), where N (SLN)= N (SLN)R={C1, C2, , Cm}, where Ci is an equivalent class in a Semantic Link Network SLN (N, SL) under an equivalent relation R; and, SL( Ci, Cj)={ SL(ni, nj) | ni, nj  a Semantic Link Network SLN (N, SL) and niCi, njCj }, 1 i, j m. 
Theorem 2.1. Let SLN (N, SL) be a Semantic Link Network, and SLN (N, SL) is the quotient Semantic Link Network constructed as above, then SLN (N, SL) keeps the three normal forms of SLN (N, SL). 
Proof. (1) If SLN is 1NF, then there do not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in SLN. For the quotient network SLN(N, SL), N(SLN)= N (SLN)R={C1, C2, , Cm}. According to the definition of the equivalence relation R, Ci  Cj=, 1 i, j m. So there do not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in SLN (N , SL ), which means that SLN (N , SL ) is also 1NF. (2) If SLN is 2NF, then there do not exist inconsistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links between the same pair of nodes in SLN. According to the construction process of the quotient Semantic Link Network, SL (Ci, Cj)={SL(ni, nj) | ni, nj  N (SLN) and niCi, njCj }, we can get that SL SLN ) SL (SLN), so there do not exist in-consistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links, in SLN (N , SL) either, which means that SLN is also 2NF. (3) If SLN is 3NF, then there do not exist isolated nodes (accessible from each other), that is for any two nodes ni, nj  N (SLN), there exists a path ni n1  nt nj from ni to nj. Then in the case of SLN, for any two nodes Ci, Cj  N SLN ), then there exists ni, nj  N (SLN) and niCi, njCj. Then we can consider the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, where Ck is the corresponding equivalence class of nk, which means that nkCk, 1 k t. Then in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, (a) if any two neighboring nodes Ck, Cp in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj satisfying Ck  Cp, then the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj is a path from Ci to nj ; (b) if there exists two neighboring nodes Ck=Cp in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, then we get a new series S  in which Ck Cp is Ck. Repeating this process finite times, we can get a new series S  with the property that any two neigh-boring nodes in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj are not equal, so the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj  is a path, and obviously that the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj is from Ci to nj. From (a) and (b), we can get that any two nodes in N (SLN ) are accessible from each other, so SLN (N , SL ) is 3NF.  Proof. (1) If SLN is 1NF, then there do not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in SLN. For the quotient network SLN(N, SL), N(SLN)= N (SLN)R={C1, C2, , Cm}. According to the definition of the equivalence relation R, Ci  Cj=, 1 i, j m. So there do not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in SLN (N , SL ), which means that SLN (N , SL ) is also 1NF. (2) If SLN is 2NF, then there do not exist inconsistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links between the same pair of nodes in SLN. According to the construction process of the quotient Semantic Link Network, SL (Ci, Cj)={SL(ni, nj) | ni, nj  N (SLN) and niCi, njCj }, we can get that SL SLN ) SL (SLN), so there do not exist in-consistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links, in SLN (N , SL) either, which means that SLN is also 2NF. (3) If SLN is 3NF, then there do not exist isolated nodes (accessible from each other), that is for any two nodes ni, nj  N (SLN), there exists a path ni n1  nt nj from ni to nj. Then in the case of SLN, for any two nodes Ci, Cj  N SLN ), then there exists ni, nj  N (SLN) and niCi, njCj. Then we can consider the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, where Ck is the corresponding equivalence class of nk, which means that nkCk, 1 k t. Then in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, (a) if any two neighboring nodes Ck, Cp in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj satisfying Ck  Cp, then the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj is a path from Ci to nj ; (b) if there exists two neighboring nodes Ck=Cp in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj, then we get a new series S  in which Ck Cp is Ck. Repeating this process finite times, we can get a new series S  with the property that any two neigh-boring nodes in the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj are not equal, so the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj  is a path, and obviously that the series S=Ci C1  Ct Cj is from Ci to nj. From (a) and (b), we can get that any two nodes in N (SLN ) are accessible from each other, so SLN (N , SL ) is 3NF.  
We have proposed a method to transform a given Semantic Link Net-work to a resource space. In fact, the transformation process is to con-struct a quotient Semantic Link Network first, then to get the corre-sponding resource space from a quotient Semantic Link Network. Ac-cording to the construction process and the definition of a quotient Semantic Link Network, we only need to show that the “strongly connect-ed component” is an equivalent relation among the nodes of the Seman-tic Link Network. 
Corollary 2.7. Let SLN (N, SL) be a Semantic Link Network, and R be the relation that “in the same strongly connected component” on SLN (N, SL), then R is an equivalent relation on SLN (N, SL). 
Because the quotient Semantic Link Network is the abstraction of the original Semantic Link Network, the construction process shows again that the resource space is the abstraction of the quotient Semantic Link Network, reflects the higher-level semantics. 
Given a resource space RS, we have constructed a Semantic Link Net-work SLN (N, SL) that is semantically equivalent to a resource space RS, if we view a Semantic Link Net-work SLN (N, SL) that is semantically equivalent to it as the underlying undirected graph, then we can study the topologi-cal properties of a Semantic Link Net-work SLN (N, SL) that is semantically equivalent to it. Here we always assume that a resource space RS is 2NF and a resource space RS's coordi-nates are flat. 
Let the weight on each edge Impi be 1, 1 i n, then we can define the distance and diameter of SLN as (Bollobás, 1998). 
Definition 2.4. For any two nodes n1 and n2 in SLN (N, SL), the distance d(n1, n2) between any two nodes n1 and n2 in SLN (N, SL) is the length of the shortest path between any two nodes n1 and n2 in SLN (N, SL). 
Definition 2.5. The diameter of the graph SLN (N, SL) is D(SLN)= Max{ d(n1, n2)| n1, n2N (SLN)}. 
For any two points p1(x1, x2, , xn) and p2(y1, y2, , yn) in the resource space RS(X1, X2, …, xn), the distance  , where di is the distance on axis Xi, 1in (Zhuge et al., 2005c). We can see that the distance d on the resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) is the Euclidian sum of di, and from Definition 2.4, the distance on SLN is equivalent to d=Min{di |1in}. As the existence of the semantic links, the distance between two nodes in SLN is much smaller than in the resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn). From this perspective, SLN is more suitable for the search and location of resources. The following theorem supports this view. 
Theorem 2.2. Let RS be a 3NF resource space, and SLN (N, SL) is the cor-responding Semantic Link Network, then SLN (N, SL) is an Euler graph, and the diameter of SLN (N, SL) is 2. 
Proof. Since RS is 3NF, from Corollary 2.3, the SLN is 3NF too, then any two nodes in the SLN are accessible from each other, i.e., the SLN is a connected graph. For any node n in the SLN, the edges Impi and Impi are present or absent simultaneously, so the degree of any node n in SLN is even. Because the degree of every node in the SLN is even, the SLN is an Euler graph. Suppose the distance d(n1, n2) between two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) is the biggest in the SLN, then D(SLN)= d(n1, n2). Then xiyi, for 1in. Else if xi=yi for some i, then there exists edge Impi between two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) such that d(n1, n2)=1. Let n3= n3(z1, z2, , zn), satisfying xizi, for 1in, then there dose not exist any semantic link between n1 and n3=, so d(n1, n3)>1= d(n1, n2), this is inconsistent with the assumption that d(n1, n2) is the biggest. So xiyi, for 1in holds and therefore d(n1, n2)> 1. Let n4= n4(x1, x2, , xn-1, yn), from x1y1 and xnyn, we can get n4  n1 and n4 n2. Then there exist edges n1Imp1 n4, and n4 Impnn2, so n1 n2 are linked by the path n1Imp1 n3Impnn2, from the definition of d(n1, n2), we can get that d(n1, n2) 2. And from d(n1, n2)> 1, we have d(n1, n2)=2. So D(SLN)= d(n1, n2)=2.  Proof. Since RS is 3NF, from Corollary 2.3, the SLN is 3NF too, then any two nodes in the SLN are accessible from each other, i.e., the SLN is a connected graph. For any node n in the SLN, the edges Impi and Impi are present or absent simultaneously, so the degree of any node n in SLN is even. Because the degree of every node in the SLN is even, the SLN is an Euler graph. Suppose the distance d(n1, n2) between two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) is the biggest in the SLN, then D(SLN)= d(n1, n2). Then xiyi, for 1in. Else if xi=yi for some i, then there exists edge Impi between two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) such that d(n1, n2)=1. Let n3= n3(z1, z2, , zn), satisfying xizi, for 1in, then there dose not exist any semantic link between n1 and n3=, so d(n1, n3)>1= d(n1, n2), this is inconsistent with the assumption that d(n1, n2) is the biggest. So xiyi, for 1in holds and therefore d(n1, n2)> 1. Let n4= n4(x1, x2, , xn-1, yn), from x1y1 and xnyn, we can get n4  n1 and n4 n2. Then there exist edges n1Imp1 n4, and n4 Impnn2, so n1 n2 are linked by the path n1Imp1 n3Impnn2, from the definition of d(n1, n2), we can get that d(n1, n2) 2. And from d(n1, n2)> 1, we have d(n1, n2)=2. So D(SLN)= d(n1, n2)=2.  
Theorem 2.2 implies that the distance between any two nodes in the 3NF (corresponding to a resource space) is either 1 or 2. And from Theo-rem 2.2 we can get the following corollary: 
Corollary 2.8. Let RS be a 3NF resource space, and SLN (N, SL) is the corresponding Semantic Link Network, then for any two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in SLN (N, SL), d(n1, n2)=1 “there exists some i, 1in, such that xi=yi”. And d(n1, n2)=2  xiyi, for 1in. 
Then we can see that the mean distance between two nodes in SLN is within 1 and 2, much smaller than in the resource space RS, which is re-lated to the dimension n and the average number of coordinates on all axes, so we can say that the Semantic Link Network is more suitable for search and location of resources than Resource Space Model. But there is one more important factor that makes the distance in the Semantic Link Network much smaller, which is that there are too much semantic links in the corresponding Semantic Link Network constructed.
