Resource analysis is to determine the application scope, to know the re-sources to be managed, and then to specify the resources in a Resource Dictionary.  
Resources usually share some common attributes, for example {name, author, owner, abstract, version, location, privilege, access-approach, ef-fective-duration, semantic relevant resources}.  The abstract attribute (can be formal or informal) represents content abstraction, or the function de-scription of a service.  
Access privilege concerns:  
1.	public  any user can access to it; 
2.	group  only group members can access to it; and,  
3.	private  only the creator can access to it. 
 The Resource Dictionary enables designers to collect and edit re-sources and finally forms the axes of the resource space by defining re-source classification hierarchy. A Resource Dictionary includes the fol-lowing operations:  
1.	Consistency checking  check the semantic consistency between descriptions.  
2.	Redundancy checking  check redundancy and delete the redundant descriptions and redundant resources. 
3.	Classification  classify resources according to the specialization relationship determined by existing taxonomy, existing classification standard,  available domain ontology, and user judgement.
