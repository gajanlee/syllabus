We have studied the relationship between the searching complexity and the distribution of coordinates on every axis when the dimension of re-source space is fixed. When changing dimension, what is the relationship between the searching complexity and the change of dimension? In the perspective of searching complexity, the dimension of resource space is the higher the better, or the lower the better? This section answers these questions.
