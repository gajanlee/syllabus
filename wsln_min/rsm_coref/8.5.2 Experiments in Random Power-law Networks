Many large networks like the hyperlink network follow the power-law distribution of node degrees (Leland et al., 1994).  the power-law distribution of node degrees is , where  , k is the degree, kmax is the maxi-mum degree, and  is the exponent of the power-law distribution of node degrees (Sarshar et al., 2004).  Researches have shown that only when the virus accumulates to certain critical threshold, the virus will be prevalent.  And, certain critical threshold does not exist when the virus follows the power-law dis-tributions.  the virus does not need to accumulate to certain threshold to propagate quickly through hubs of the hyperlink network. 
The reason of considering power-law networks is that some unstruc-tured Peer-to-Peer networks are characterized by random power-law and heavy tailed degree distributions.  To keep the peers connected, we adjust degree from 15 to 100 following the aforementioned distribution with  = 2.0 in constructing random power-law networks.  For each link, the start peer and the end peer are selected randomly, and as a result, the random power-law graph is constructed with average 14 neighbors at the lowest level in the experiment.  The view size of other levels is 2, a rather small size. The community size is 100.  
The simulation results from gossip networks without considering se-mantic partitions are denoted as FlatGossip, while the results making use of semantic partitions are denoted as RSMGossip.  In the RSM-based gos-sip mechanisms, different number of gossip levels is chosen according to the comparison between the query and the category of the initiator.  If the query strictly belongs to one category, then routing the query to oth-er categories will not bring any benefit.  And in this situation, the results are denoted by RSMGossip1.   
When the query corresponds to several categories, the query should be routed to all the categories that are potential to have the answers.  For example, the query could be answered in 3 or 5 categories, and the results are de-noted by RSMGossip3 and RSMGossip5. 
Both the random networks and the random power-law networks have the same network loads, if Both the random networks and the random power-law networks have the equal size and the gos-sip mechanisms have the same parameters (fanout and TTL).  Fig. 8.5 shows the average network load according to different parameters.  The horizontal axis denotes the parameter TTL, and the vertical axis denotes the average network load during 100 times operations.   
As Fig. 8.5(a) presents, we set the fanout value as 2 uniformly and range TTL from 5 to 10.  Fig. 8.5(b) and Fig. 8.5(c) are obtained in the similar way by using different parameter values.  We can see from the figures that the network loads are reduced sharply when adopting the par-tition-based gossip mechanisms.  Taking fanout = 3 for example, when TTL approaches 8, about 88.9%, 66.7% and 44.5% network load is re-duced by RSMGossip1, RSMGossip3 and RSMGossip5 respectively com-pared with the flat gossip mechanism.  This justifies our approach. 
During message dissemination, the number of peers that do not receive the disseminated messages is an important metric. Compared with previ-ous algorithms, the number of peers that do not receive the disseminated messages de-creases evidently after adopting the proposed mechanisms as presented in Fig. 8.6. Taking fanout = 3 for example, when TTL approaches 6, about 36.44, 109.32 and 182.2 number of peers, which should receive the dis-seminated message, have not received the dis-seminated message when using RSMGossip1, RSMGossip3 and RSMGossip5 mechanisms separately.  Meanwhile it is 416.57 for the flat gossip mechanism.  The performance is improved con-siderably though improved is partially because the range is decreased for the RSM-based mechanism. decreased justifies the rationale of the RSM-based mechanism. 
For the random power-law networks, the results about the number of peers that do not receive messages are shown in Fig. 8.7. We can see the similar phenomena as those on the random networks: the number of peers that do not receive messages is also reduced sharply compared with the partition-based gossip mechanisms with the flat gossip.  Taking fan-out = 3 for example, when TTL approaches 6, about 35.77, 107.31 and 178.85 number of peers on average do not receive the disseminated mes-sage when making use of RSMGossip1, RSMGossip3 and RSMGossip5 mechanisms respectively.  Meanwhile for the flat gossip mechanism it is 455.13.  The results are better than those on the random networks for the RSM-based mechanisms, while the flat gossip mechanism performs worse on the random power-law networks than those on the random networks. This also declares the necessary of our approaches.
