The Union View of resource space and Semantic Link Network not only maps resource spaces into resource class hierarchies but also inherits all operations of the RSM. The informal description of the four RSM-based operations on The Union View of resource space and Semantic Link Network is as follows: 
Join: Assume that RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are two resource class hierarchies which correspond to the resource spaces RS1(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm) and RS2(Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn) respectively. And RSG(CS, E) is derived from the Join operation on RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) with axes Xt+1, …, Xm as described in theorem 2.4. For any resource class c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in RSG1(CS1, E1), there must exist the corresponding resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E) according to the definition of resource class hierarchy. Then, any external relationships starting from or ending at C1 should be transferred to c. 
Disjoin: Assume that RSG(CS, E) is a resource class hierarchy corre-sponding to the resource space RS(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn). RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are derived from the Disjoin operation on RSG(CS, E) with axes Xt+1, …, Xm as described in theorem 2.5. For any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E), there must exist corresponding resource class c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in RSG1(CS, E) according to the definition of resource class hierar-chy. Then, any external relationships starting from or ending at any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E) should be transferred to corresponding resource class c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm). Any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in RSG(CS, E) satisfies: there at least exits one i (m+1≤i≤n) such that Ci ≠ i, if there exists any external relationship starting from or ending at any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E), then insert any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E) and all external relationships starting from or ending at any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E) into the destination SLN and insert the subtype relationship between any resource class c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n) in RSG(CS, E) and the resource class (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, m+1, …, n). 
Merge: Assume that RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are two resource class hierarchies corresponding to the resource spaces RS1(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) and RS2(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) respectively. And RSG(CS, E) is derived from the Merge operation on RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) by merg-ing X and X into X as described in theorem 2.6. Let ac, ac and ac be the axis resource classes corresponding to axes X, X and X respectively. For any resource class c1 = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1), if any resource class c1 = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1) is not equal to ac, then we can find the resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E). Any external relationships starting from or ending at any resource class c1 = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1) should be transferred to c. If any resource class c1 = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1) is equal to ac, then any external rela-tionships starting from or ending at any resource class c1 = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1) should be transferred to each of the immediate successors of ac in RSG(CS, E). 
Split: Assume that RSG(CS, E) is one resource class hierarchy corre-sponding to the resource space RS1(X1, X2, …, Xm, X). RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are derived from the Split operation on RSG(CS, E) by splitting X into X and X as described in theorem 2.7. Let ac, ac and ac be the axis resource classes corresponding to axes X, X and X respec-tively. For any resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E), if any resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E) is not equal to ac, then we can find the resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG1(CS1, E1) or RSG2(CS2, E2). Any external relationships starting from or ending at any resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E) should be transferred to c. If any resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E) is equal to ac, then any external relationships starting from or ending at any resource class c = (C1, C2,…, Cm, C) in RSG(CS, E) should be trans-ferred to both ac and ac 
The following theorems indicate that the RSM-based operations keep some SLN normal forms. 
Theorem 2.8. Both the Join operation and the Merge operation of the Resource Space Model keep 1NF-SLN, 2NF-SLN and 3NF-SLN of the original Semantic Link Network. 
Neither the disjoin operation nor the split operation increase semantic-equivalent nodes and links, so they keep 1NF and 2NF. But they may break accessibility, so they do not keep 3NF. 
Theorem 2.9. Both disjoin operation and split operation of the Resourcce Space Model keep 1NF-SLN and 2NF-SLN of the original Semantic Link Networks.
