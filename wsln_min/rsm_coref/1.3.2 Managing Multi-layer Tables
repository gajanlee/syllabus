Multi-layer tables provide integrated information of multiple abstraction levels from different analysis.  The higher layers provide more abstract information.  The lower layers constitute a fine classification of the high-er layer, for example, professor, associate professor and assistant profes-sor constitute a fine classification of the teacher class. Table 1.1 shows such a table on university human resources.  
The traditional relational data model excludes this type of tables since the first normal form of relational data model requires the flat table and atomic fields.  Many relational tables are needed to decompose the multi-layer table if we use relational data model to realize the management of human resources with this form. 
The table naturally corresponds to a 2-dimensional resource space as shown in Fig. 1.8.  A point represents a set of persons of certain depart-ment and certain rank.  Moreover, a name axis in alphabetical order can be added to form a 3-dimensional resource space.
