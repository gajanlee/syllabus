A resource space is an n-dimensional space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn), where Xi = {Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim} is an axis defined by a set of coordinates. A point p(C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) is determined by the coordinate values at every ax-es. A point p(C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) can uniquely determine a resource set, where each element is called a resource entry. Point and resource entry are two fundamental operation units of the Resource Space Model. 
Fig.2.2 is an example of a 3-dimentional resource space Spec-Apart-Gen(Specialization, Apartment, Gender) specifying the student infor-mation of a college. Three axes are Specialization = {math, chemistry, physics}, Apartment = {1#, 2#, 3#} and Gender = {male, female}. Each point denotes a class of students, for example, the point (math, 1#, male) represents all the male students who belong to the department of math and live in apartment no.1 in a college. And each resource entry in the point (math, 1#, male) corresponds to a student in a college. 
Class hierarchy can be defined top-down from any coordinate at an ax-is. Take Fig.2.2 for example, the coordinate chemistry on axis Specializa-tion is classified into g1, g2 and g3 in terms of grade, and then g1, g2 and g3 can be further classified according to class. The label of each node is determined by a full path from the root, so the leaf node chemistry.g1.c1 can be dis-tinguished from chemistry.g2.c1. 
A Semantic Link Network consists of a semantic node set Semantic-Nodes, a semantic link set SemanticLinks and a reasoning rule set SLNRules, denoted as <SemanticNodes, SemanticLinks, SLNRules>.  Any semantic link in a semantic link set SemanticLinks is a binary relation between two se-mantic nodes in SemanticNodes.  For any three semantic nodes A, B and C in a semantic node set if there exist two semantic links AB and BC in a semantic link set SemanticLinks, and there exists a semantic link rule XY, YZ  XZ (denoted as = in simple) in a reasoning rule set SLNRules, then A C can be derived out and added to a semantic link set SemanticLinks (Zhuge, 2003).  Two semantic link networks can be merged into one by common nodes or by adding semantic links between nodes of different networks. 
Normal forms of the Semantic Link Network are to guarantee the cor-rectness of the Semantic Link Network's semantics and operations. For example, Xis-part-of→Y and Xisn’t-part-of→Y may exist in the same Semantic Link Network because different users may operate on the same Semantic Link Network. The following normal forms of the Semantic Link Network are to resolve the redundancy and inconsistency issues. 
1.	If there does not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in a given Seman-tic Link Network, then we say that a given Seman-tic Link Network is the first normal form SLN (1NF-SLN). 
2.	If a Semantic Link Network is 1NF and there does not exist incon-sistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links between the same pair of nodes, then we say that a Semantic Link Network is the second normal form Semantic Link Network (2NF-SLN). 
3.	If a Semantic Link Network is a 2NF and there does not exist isolat-ed nodes (accessible from each other), then we say that a Semantic Link Network is the third normal form Semantic Link Network (3NF-SLN). 
An ideal Semantic Link Network is a semantic “map” of distributed versatile resources to enable people to autonomously publish, manage and browse resources according to semantic links in a semantic “map” of distributed versatile resources to enable people to autonomously publish, manage and browse resources according to semantic links in the map. 
Each resource defined in the Resource Space Model can have a map-ping image in the Semantic Link Network. The purpose is different from the knowledge portals that only provide knowledge services (Mack et al., 2001). Users can make and use the orthogonal classification semantics and the link semantics according to Users's cognition on the real world. the orthogonal classification semantics can help users focus users's operation destination. the Semantic Link Network reflects the semantic clues be-tween versatile resources. The integration of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network combines the classification semantics and relational semantics. 
The normalization theories of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network support a kind of single semantic point of accessing rele-vant semantic content, i.e., single semantic image (Zhuge, 2004d). Knowledge portals are difficult to realize this function. Abstract knowledge like traditional semantic network and rule base can be derived from Semantic Link Network by generalization, can be organized ac-cording to the orthogonal semantics in the up-level space, and thus ena-ble the future interconnection environment to implement intelligent ser-vices. 
A Global Semantic Overlay Grid can be built by integrating the Re-source Space Model and Semantic Link Network as shown in Fig.2.3.  
A local Semantic Overlay Grid has four layers: the entity layer, the lo-cal Semantic Link Network, the local resource space layer, and the man-agement mechanism of the resource space and the Semantic Link Net-work. The integration of the Resource Space Model and the lo-cal Semantic Link Network lays the foundation of the Local Semantic Overlay Grid. A normalized Local Semantic Overlay Grid requires that both the Resource Space Model and the lo-cal Semantic Link Network satisfy the normal forms. The Global Overlay Semantic Grid consists of many Local Semantic Overlay Grids connected by the semantic links. A Normalized Global Semantic Overlay Grid requires that all Local Semantic Overlay Grids are normalized and that the lo-cal Semantic Link Network is normalized. 
The Semantic Overlay Grid integrates the advantages of the normaliza-tion (the normalization of both Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network) and self-organization (local Semantic Overlay Grids intercon-nect with each other autonomously). the normalization of both Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network reflects the op-timization ideal of the Grid.
