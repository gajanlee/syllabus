In this chapter, we devise a specific multidimensional access method named C-tree for resource space storage. a specific multidimensional access method named C-tree for resource space storage organizes resources by classi-fication semantics and stores semantic-close resources in adjoining place of storage space. Moreover, a specific multidimensional access method named C-tree for resource space storage preserves hierarchy semantics between concepts. 
We state the problem formally as follows:  
How to make the underlying index structures represent hierarchy seman-tics between concepts so as to implement effective and efficient resource in-sertion, deletion, exact query and range query on resource space.   
Hierarchy semantics is prevailing in concept classification. Hierarchy semantics reflects two important relationships between concepts. One is concept combina-tion. For example, a car is composed of wheel, engine and fuel. The other is concept refinement. For example, book is one kind of publication. In fact, we recognize objects in the real world by such hierarchy semantics in many situations. If such hierarchy semantics is preserved in the process of index creation, we can utilize such hierarchy semantics to organize resources much better.  
The underlying index structures should satisfy the following two goals. 
1.	The semantic Goal  the preservation of hierarchical semantics between concepts. Hierarchy semantics between concepts should be kept in the underlying structure. Concepts and Concepts's hierarchy relationships are designed by system managers according to classification semantics. The design process of RSM already refines resource organization to a certain extent. The normal forms of RSM guarantee the quality of resource classification at the logical level. Meanwhile, RSM matches people’s thinking way of resource organization.  
2.	The operation Goal  efficient resource operations including insertion, deletion, exact query and range query. The reason of preserving the hierarchical semantics of resource space is that the underlying indexing structure should be guided by such semantics in the process of resource insertion, deletion and query.
