The bio-information on the Web is currently managed by versatile data-bases developed by different countries.  The Resource Space Model can be used to reform the existing bio-information retrieval and management systems. All the bio-information databases can be uniformly and normal-ly specified in the resource space.  Bio-information can be specified by a two-dimensional resource space as shown in Fig.1.12, where “PubMed”, “Structure”, “Genome” and “PopSet” respectively stand for: biomedical literature, macromolecular structure, complete genome assemblies, and population study data sets.
