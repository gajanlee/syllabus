The Resource Space Model was proposed as a parallelism of the RDBM. In fact, a relational database system excluding null information can be represented by a set of resource spaces. Thus, the proposed resource space algebra and resource space calculus have at least as powerful expressive-ness as the RDBM. The following is the transforming process from a relational table to a resource space. 
1.	For each table T(A1, A2, …, An) in a given relational database system, create a resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) by naming a resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) after the table name, establishing a one-to-one relationship between the axes of a resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) and the attributes of the table (e.g., Ai corresponds to Xi), and naming each axis of a resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) after the corresponding attribute name. For each tuple t(x1, x2, …, Xn) in the table, insert xi (1in) as a coordinate into the axis Xi if no coordinate duplication exists. And then insert a resource-entry into the point p(x1, x2, …, Xn) to represent the tuple t(x1, x2, …, Xn). If a tuple t(x1, x2, …, Xn) is deleted from the table, just delete the resource-entry residing in the point p(x1, x2, …, xn) and leave the point p(x1, x2, …, xn) and corresponding coordinates alone. 
2.	For each table T(A1, A2, …, An), let A1… Am (1mn) be the key of T. Then, the axes X1… Xm will be set as the key of RS. Thus, there do not exist any two different points p(x1… xm, xm+1…xn) and p’(x1… xm, x’m+1…x’n) such that both p and p’ contain resource-entries simultaneously. The functional dependency in the relational database has been represented by the classification relationship in the RSM. 
Since the one-to-one mapping between tables and resource spaces as well as between operations on relational table and operations on the re-source space, the basic operations (Union, Difference, Cartesian Product, Selection and Project) in relational database can be easily simulated by Resource Space operations: Merge, Difference, Join, Selection and Projec-tion (Zhuge, 2004a). Thus, any information represented by the relational model can be easily managed by the Resource Space Model. 
Theorem 4.6. For any relational database system without null infor-mation, the generated resource spaces satisfy the first/second/third nor-mal forms of the Resource Space Model.  
Proof. Let T(A1, A2, …, An) be a relational table and RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) be the generated resource space. According to the creation process of RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), it is clear that RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) satisfies the first and second normal forms. In the follow-ing, we prove that RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) conforms to the third normal form. All resources (tuples) managed by RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) come from the table T. For any axis Xi and any tuple t in T, there exists a coordinate on any axis Xi such that a coordinate on Xi is the projection of T on any axis Xi. So tR(Xi) holds. On the other hand, R(Xi) only contains the resources derived from the tuples in T. Thus, for any two axes any axis Xi and Xj, R(Xi)=R(Xj) holds. We can conclude that XiXj holds. So RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) satisfies the third normal form.
