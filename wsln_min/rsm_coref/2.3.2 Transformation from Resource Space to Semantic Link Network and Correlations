There are multiple ways to transform a resource space to a Semantic Link Network, but semantics may lose during transformation.  So it is im-portant to ensure the semantic equivalence of transformation.  The following is a semantically equivalent transformation. Fig.2.5 depicts the transformation process. 
Take nodes in the resource space as nodes in the Semantic Link Net-work; 
Define the semantic links between n1(x1, …, xn) and n2(y1, …, yn) as: 
Where Xi is the axis of the resource space RS, and impi means that node n1(x1, …, xn) implies n2(y1, …, yn) on the semantics of Xi. Then we can get SL (SLN) from SL (SLN)=n1,n2N SL(n1, n2). 
Because the semantic links are directed, SL(xi, yi) SL(yi, yi) in most cases. If yi = yi, then SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= Impi. On the contrary, if SL(xi, yi) = Impi and SL(yi, xi)= Impi, then yi = yi. It is clear that Impi is transitive. For any node n(x1, x2, , xn) in the resulting SLN (N, SL), we have R(xi)={R(yi)|SL(xi , yi) = Impi}. Then, from the steps of construc-tion, it is clear that the resulting SLN (N, SL) is semantically equivalent to the resource space RS (P, E). 
In a resource space RS, an axis with hierarchical coordinates can be transformed into an axis with flat coordinates if only the leaf nodes of each hierarchy are considered. So here focuses on the flat cases. In this case, the semantic link network SLN corresponds to a resource space RS regularly. For any two points p1(x1, x2, , xn) and p2(y1, y2, , yn) in a resource space RS, we have xi = yi or R(xi)R(yi)=, 1 i n, i.e., both “xi implies yi” and “yi implies yi” hold or neither hold. Correspondingly, for any two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in the semantic link network SLN, SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= Impi or SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= , i.e., there are no semantic links between xi and yi. 
Given a resource space RS, there is a semantically equivalent Semantic Link Network SLN, so we can compare the normal forms of a resource space RS and a semantically equivalent Semantic Link Network SLN to study the correlations between the normal forms of RS. 
Corollary 2.4. A 1NF-RSM can be transformed to a 1NF-SLN. 
Proof. If RS is 1NF, then there does not exist name duplication between coordinates at any axis, so there cannot be the same points in RS. Sup-pose SLN is the corresponding semantic link network of RS, from N (Sup-pose SLN) =P (RS), we can get that there does not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in Sup-pose SLN, so Sup-pose SLN is also the 1NF.  
Corollary 2.5. A 2NF-RSM can be transformed to a 2NF-SLN. 
Proof. If RS is a 2NF, then for any axis, any two coordinates are inde-pendent from each other. Suppose SLN is the corresponding semantic link network of RS, then there do not exist semantic-equivalent nodes in SLN. And for any pair of nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in SLN, the semantic links between any pair of nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in the SLN fall into two cases: SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= Impi or SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= , so there do not exist incon-sistent semantic links and duplicate semantic links between any pair of nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in the SLNn2(y1, y2, , yn, i.e., SLN is the 2NF. 
Corollary 2.6. A 3NF-RSM can be transformed to a 3NF-SLN. 
Proof. If RS is a 3NF, then any two axes of RS are orthogonal with each other, in other words, every axis Xi can represent all the resources in RS, formally, R(X1)=R(X2)==R(Xn) (Zhuge et al., 2005c), this guarantees that any points in the form of { p(x1, x2, , xn)| xi Xi} are meaningful. Suppose SLN is the corresponding semantic link network of RS, from N (SLN)=P (RS), we have: any nodes in SLN in the form of { n(x1, x2, , xn)| xi Xi} are also meaningful. Then, for any two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) and n2(y1, y2, , yn) in SLN, if there exists some i, 1in, such that xi=yi, then SL(xi, yi) =SL(yi, xi)= Impi, then any two nodes n1(x1, x2, , xn) can be accessed from each other. Else if xiyi, for 1in hold, let n3= n3(x1, x2, , xn-1, yn), from x1y1 and xnyn, we can get n3  n1 and n3 n2. Then there exist semantic links n1Imp1 n3, and n3Impnn2, so n1 n2 can also be accessed from each other by the chain n1Imp1 n3Impnn2. So any two nodes in SLN are accessible from each other, i.e., SLN is the third-normal-form.  
The above three corollaries further confirm that the normal forms of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network have the common properties in solving the redundancy and inconsistency.
