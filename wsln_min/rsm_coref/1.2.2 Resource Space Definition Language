The Resource Space Definition Language RSDL defines the commands for specifying and modifying resource spaces, in particular, the schemas for resource spaces. 
A resource space can be created by the following command, where RS is the name of A resource space, Xi is the name of A resource space's axis, Cij is the coordinate of Xi, and the URSL is the location of A resource space.  The integrity constraints set constraints on axes to ensure the correctness of operations. CREATE  SPACE  RS (X1, X2, …, Xn)  [AT  the URSL] WHERE  X1 = {C11, …, C1u }, …, Xn = {Cn1, …, Cnv} <integrity constraint1> <integrity constraintm> 
The drop command is for deleting a resource space including all the indices and schemas. DROP  RSPACE  R 
The modify command is used on an existing resource space to add or drop axes or coordinates. For example, an axis can be added to a resource space by using the following command, where RS is the name of an existing resource space, axisi is the name of an axis, and <Ci1, …, Cij> is an existing resource space's coordinate list. MODIFY  SPACE  RS ADD  AXIS  Xi <Ci1, …, Cij> 
The axes of a resource space can be listed by using the following command, where RS is the name of an existing resource space. USING  RS  LIST  AXES 
Similarly, the coordinates of a given axis in a resource space RS can be listed by using the following command: USING  RS  LIST  COORD  OF  AXIS X
