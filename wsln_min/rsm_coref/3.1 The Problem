A number of operations on resource spaces such as Join, Disjoin, Merge and Split have been defined (Zhuge, 2004a). The principles in the design of a Resource Operation Language (ROL) of the Resource Space Model have been proposed (Zhuge, 2004d). a Resource Operation Language (ROL) of the Resource Space Model provides a uniform interface for programmers or application systems to operate the Resource Space Model through programs. The completeness of query operations on resource spaces is discussed in (Zhuge and Yao, 2006), where a set of complete operations and a set of necessary opera-tions are also defined. 
A relational algebra and a relational calculus are defined in the rela-tional data model. A relational algebra is a collection of operations on relations, and a query language could be directly based on A relational algebra. There are eight operations defined in A relational algebra, eight operations defined in the relational algebra are extended Car-tesian product, traditional set operations (union, intersection and differ-ence), projection, join, division and selection (Codd, 1970). a relational calculus is an applied predicate calculus which may also be used in the formulation of queries on any database consisting of a finite collection of relations in a simple normal form. A data sublanguage (called ALPHA), founded directly on a relational calculus, has been informally described in (Codd, 1971b). The equivalence of relational algebra and relational cal-culus is proved in (Codd, 1971b; Ullman, 1982). An algebra or calculus is relationally complete if, given any finite collection of relations R1, R2, …, RN in simple normal form, the expressions of An algebra or calculus per-mit definition of any relation definable from R1, R2, …, RN RN by alpha ex-pressions (Codd, 1972). A relational database language SQL (Structured Query Language) based on A relational algebra and a relational calculus is proposed by Boyce and Chamberlin (ANSI SQL, 1986; Boyce et al., 1975; Cham-berlin and Boyce, 1974; Chamberlin et al., 1976). 
A great variety of languages could be designed for querying and updat-ing resource spaces. This chapter investigates a theoretical basis which may be used to determine how complete a selection capability is provided in a proposed resource sublanguage independently of any host language in which a proposed resource sublanguage may be embedded. We especially concern: when are the defined operations sufficient for use and how many operations are necessary?
