The Resource Space Model uses hierarchical classification semantics to reflect semantics in the real world, document world, machine world and mental world.  Relational tables are not effective in supporting hierar-chical classification semantics. XML files bring into resource redundan-cy. Moreover, XML files's performance in multi-attribute search is not good. Multidimensional access methods depend on linear order between coordi-nates of axis, while there is no linear order on coordinates in The Resource Space Model.  
The proposed RSM storage mechanism transforms a resource space in-to a multidimensional bit string space by encoding coordinates into bit strings, and then uses C-tree to index a multidimensional bit string space. Hierarchy semantics is embodied in bit strings and used by C-tree in resource insertion and deletion to group semantic-close resources in disk. C-tree is not only a novel multidimensional indexing structure but also a semantic-based resource re-organization mechanism for effi-cient search.
