Given a resource space, it is important for us to know the relationship be-tween the searching efficiency and a resource space's dimensions as well as the relation-ship between the searching efficiency and the coordinates at every axis. Is the dimension of a resource space the higher the better, the lower the bet-ter, or, other cases?  Is the distribution of coordinates at every axis the evener the better? The answers help design, analyze and understand searching resource space.
