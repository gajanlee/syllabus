We use  to represent a resource space, an axis, a point or a coordinate of the RSM and R() represents the resources that  can contain. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a resource space. RS(X1, X2, … , Xn)'s axes Xi = {Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim} can be ex-tended to Xi* = {Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim, i}, 1in. A point taking the coordi-nate value i on an axis means that an axis has no restriction on A point. For example, if a student belongs to the point (Specialization, 3#, male) in the resource space Spec-Apart-Gen, then a student may major in math, chemistry, physics or any other specialization. Meanwhile, we in-troduce a constant i at each axis Xi that is equivalent to the union of Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim in semantics, i.e. R(i) = Ci1)  Ci2)  … R(Cim). Thus, we say that i is derived from Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim. So R(i)  R(i) holds. 
Definition 2.7. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a resource space and Xi*, 1in be a resource space's extended axes. The set of resources represented by (1, …, i-1, i, i+1,…, n) is defined as the axis resource class of axis Xi, denoted as aci. the axis resource class of axis Xi, denoted as aci and each relation in the Cartesian product X1*  X2*  … Xn* are generally called resource classes. Particularly, the relation (1, 2, …, n) is called base resource class, denoted as rootRS. 
In fact, the resource class (C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) is the set of resources which simultaneously satisfies all the conditions C1,j1, C2,j2, …, and Cn,jn on corresponding axes in the resource space. And the base resource class (1, 2, …, n) actually represents the resource space. Take the re-source space Spec-Apart-Gen as an example, the base resource class (Spe-cialization, Apartment, Gender) denotes all the students concerned by the re-source space Spec-Apart-Gen. Regardless the gender, the resource class (physics, 3#, Gen-der) represents all the students who are major in physics and live in 3# apartment. 
For any two resource classes c = (C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) and c = (C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) in a resource space, if R(C1,j1)  R(C1,j1), R(C2,j2)  R(C2,j2), …, R(Cn,jn)  R(Cn,jn) hold respectively, then c is called the subclass of c = (C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) and c is called the superclass of the resource class c. And this inclusion relation-ship is denoted as c c c. 
The inclusion relationship existing between c and c is a particular case of the subtype relationship defined in (Zhuge, 2003). Since The inclusion relationship existing between c and c exists only between resource classes in the resource class hi-erarchy, for the sake of representation simplicity we also name the inclu-sion relationship as the internal relationship and any other relationships as external relationships. 
Theorem 2.3. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a resource space and Xi* (1in) be a resource space's extended axes. Any axis resource class aci of axis Xi is one of the subclasses of the base resource class rootRS of a resource space. And Any axis resource class aci of axis Xi is one of the super-classes of any of the resource classes (x1, …, xi-1, xi, xi+1…, Xn), where xj belongs to Xj* (1j i1 or i+1jn) and xi be-longs to xi. 
Proof. (1) For the axis resource class aci = (1, …, i-1, i, i+1,…, n) and the base resource class rootRS = (1, 2,…, n), we have R(1)  R(1), …, R(i-1)  R(i-1), R(i)  R(i), R(i+1)  R(i+1), …R(n)  R(n) hold re-spectively. So the axis resource class aci is one of the subclasses of the base resource class rootRS = (1, 2,…, n). (2) For any resource class c = (x1, …, xi-1, xi, xi+1…, xn) in RS where xj belongs to Xj* (1ji1 or i+1jn) and xi be-longs to Xi. It is obvious that any resource class c = (x1, …, xi-1, xi, xi+1…, xn is one of the subclasses of the resource class c = (1, …, i-1, xi, i+1…, n). According to the definition of i, we have R(xi)  R(i). Thus any resource class c = (x1, …, xi-1, xi, xi+1…, xn is one of the subclass of the axis resource class aci. So the axis resource class aci is one of the superclasses of the resource class (x1, …, xi-1, xi, xi+1…, xn).  
Theorem 2.3 indicates that the introduction of axis resource classes will not break the inclusion relationships in the resource class hierarchy of a certain resource space. The resource class set of the resource class hi-erarchy is defined as follows: 
Definition 2.8. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a resource space and Xi*(1in) be a resource space's extended axes. The set CS = X1*  X2*  … Xn*  {(1, …, i-1, i, i+1, …, n) | 1 in} is called the resource class set of a resource space. 
In the resource class hierarchy of a given resource space, only the in-clusion relationships between resource classes are concerned. The inclu-sion relationship is reflexive, asymmetric and transitive, and The inclu-sion relationship supports multi-inheritance. Thus, the resource class hierarchy of a given resource space a given resource space can be viewed as a directed graph consisting of a given resource space's resource class set and only the in-clusion relationships between resource classes. In a directed graph, (v1, v2, …, vn) will be used to denote one path from v1 to vn. the resource class hierarchy of a given resource space a given resource space can be defined as follows: 
Definition 2.9. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a resource space. The resource class hierarchy of a resource space is defined as the directed graph RSG(CS, E), where 
1.	CS is the resource class set of RS; 
2.	For any resource classes c1, c2 CS, if <c1, c2> E, then c2cc1 holds; 
3.	For any resource classes c1, c2 CS, if c2 c c1 holds, then there ex-ists at least one path (c1, cj1, cj2, …, cjm, c2). 
The second condition in definition 2.9 is used to guarantee that RSG(CS, E) can only include the valid inclusion relationships in RS. And the third condition implies that all inclusion relationships in RS should be implicitly included in RSG(CS, E). Fig.2.7 is the illustration of a flat resource space and a part of a flat resource space's resource class hierarchy.
