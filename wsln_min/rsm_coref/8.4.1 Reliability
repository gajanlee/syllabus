The following analysis shows that the proposed mechanisms are reliable. Suppose the number of peers in the system is n, and the resource space partitions peers in the system into m categories.  For simplicity, group members are assumed to be evenly distributed, that is, the sizes of categories are equal to n/m approximately.  The following notations are used in the following discussion. 
1.	sthe source peer of one message; 
2.	the probability of message loss during the gossip process. 
3.	the probability of a peer crash during the gossip process. 
4.	Athe event that there is a directed path from s to all peers in the category s's belongs to. 
5.	Bthe event that there is at least one link directed from s to other categories. 
6.	P(C) the probability that the event C happens. 
Gossip style protocols are reliable in a probabilistic sense.  According to the analysis in (Kermarrec et al, 2003), the probability of a given peer re-ceiving the disseminated message is 1−(1/nfanout)(1 + o(1)). And if the message loss is considered, the probability is 1−(1/n(1−ε) fanout)(1+o(1)). 
Messages can be disseminated in three different mechanisms: 
1.	Using the partition tree, the query initiator selects one level in the query initiator's views.  Thereafter the query initiator randomly selects one peer in the query initiator's view at one level in its views, and a gossip process is initiated with one peer in its view being the source of the gossip.  In this precondition: P(every peer in the select-ed category receives the message) = P(A)∙P(B) = (1 − (1/(n/m)(1−ε)fanout) (1 + o(1)))∙(1−ε)∙(1−τ). Applications could make the messages com-municate reliably through protocols like TCP, and in this way,  would approach zero.  The large number of peers n makes the proto-col reliable. 
2.	The query initiator randomly selects one peer from each of The query initiator's views at different levels, and disseminates the message to one peer, (the num-ber of levels is m at most).  one peer launch the gossip pro-cess in the gossip pro-cess's community in parallel.  And under the condition: P(every peer in the system receives the message)= Pm(A)∙P(B)= (1−(1/(n/m)(1−ε) fanout)(1+o(1)))m ∙(1−ε)∙(1−τ). In the selection process, if sending message to one peer is failed, another peer could be selected randomly in the view at the same level.  In this way, the negative influence of m in the previous equation is further reduced to guarantee the reliability of the mechanism. 
3.	The query initiator selects peers in views of different levels with dif-ferent probabilities.  And then peers in views of different levels receive the message and disseminate the message in peers in views of different levels's communities. Therefore, P(every peer in their communities receives the message) = Pl(A)∙P(B), where l is the number of communities being selected and 1 ≤ l ≤ m.  Conse-quently, Pm(A)∙P(B) ≤ Pl(A)∙P(B) ≤ P(A)∙P(B), and the gossip process adopting the proposed mechanism is reliable.
