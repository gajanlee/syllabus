Fig. 6.11 depicts an example of C-tree. Three classification points p1, p2 and p3 are grouped together in node A. The other two are grouped in node B. A and B are the children of the root node.  
Fig. 6.12 describes the corresponding external memory storage using a single file file_ctree. a single file file_ctree is divided into pages each of which corresponds to a certain size of consecutive storage space. The size of the page would better match diskâ€™s block size to enable efficient page read and write. The first page is allocated for root node of C-tree in default. Each of the other tree nodes is also stored in one page which is randomly allocated. The pointer to the child node in C-tree is transformed to page shift of the child node in C-tree page in file_ctree. Each point inside a leaf node represents some kind of conceptual classification. Each point inside a leaf node is accompanied by the shift number of the page storing the page storing its resources's resources, for example, a list of file paths if its resources are local files, or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) in the network setting.
