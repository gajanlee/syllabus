A node in the structured P2P RSM may fail or depart without warning. We need to ensure that the zones A node in the structured P2P RSM occupied are taken over by the remaining nodes such that the structured P2P RSM is robust to node failures. As mentioned, under normal conditions a node sends periodic update messages, which contains a node's zone coordinates and a list of a node's neighbors and its neighbors's zone coordinates, to each of a node's neighbors. Node fail-ure can be detected when an update message from a neighbor is pro-longed. We have explained that such an event of node failure does not detain the routing process, since the routing message can be forwarded to another node. However, the zone of the failed node should be taken over by an existing node to preserve the integrity of the structured P2P RSM. 
To complete the zone takeover, one of the failed nodeâ€™s neighbors should be selected to run an immediate takeover algorithm, which is sim-ilar to the takeover algorithm of normal node departure. However in this case the resource indices held by the departing node would be lost until the state is refreshed by the holders of the resources.  
The selection of this neighbor is based on a timer-based protocol. Once a node has detected that a node's neighbor has died, a node initiates the takeover mechanism and starts a takeover timer running. Each neighbor of its neighbor will do this independently, with a takeover timer initialized in pro-portion to the number of resource indices occupied by a node. When a takeover timer expires, a node sends a takeover message with a node's own zone in-formation to all of its neighbor neighbors. When receiving a takeover message, a node cancels a node's own timer if the zone in a takeover message is more suitable than its own timer to produce a valid single zone, or a node replies with a node's own takeover message. In this way, a neighbor, which is still alive, is efficiently chosen to complete the zone takeover.
