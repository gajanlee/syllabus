Just as the relational calculus, the resource space calculus can be used to represent what is a query for, but the resource space calculus does not provide the process to an-swer the query. This section proposes an algorithm for converting any al-pha expression in the resource space calculus to a corresponding series of operations in the resource space algebra. 
For a given alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): , where p(X1, X2, ..., Xn) is the target point and  is the qualification, we use the following algo-rithm based on Codd's reduction algorithm to transform resource space calculus to resource space algebra (Codd, 1972). 
(1)	Suppose that X1, X2, ..., Xn come from RS1, RS2, …, RSn respectively, all of which are resource spaces in . For RSi (1i n), we use RSi* to denote the union of all the resource spaces union-compatible with RSi (1i n) . Create a new resource space RS which is the projection of the resource space RS1* RS2*  … RSn* on axes X1, X2, ..., and Xn. The qualification  is transformed into ’=RS(p)  . 
(2)	Since the qualification ’ is the logical concatenation of a series of WFF over p using ,  and , the qualification ’ can be easily trans-formed into the disjunctive normal form. In this transformation pro-cess, any formula preceded by qualifiers ( or ) is viewed as a whole and any logical operators in this type of formulas are not concerned. Each conjunctive clause in the disjunctive normal form is a WFF over p. For each conjunctive clause (WFF over p) U1  Up  V do from step (3) to step (8). 
(3)	In U1  Up  V, for each Uj (1j p) and the range formula Ui (p+1i q) associated with each qualifier ( or ), apply the follow-ing rewriting rules in the given order. 
(a)	Substitute each rang formula RSk(pk) over pk by the resource space RSk. 
(b)	Substitute  and  by  and – respectively. 
(c)	Substitute  by . 
Then we can use a series of set-related operations (union, intersec-tion and difference) to change Uj (1jq) into Sj such that Sj only contains a new resource space. For example, if Uj (1jq) = RS1(p)  RS2(p), then Sj = RS1  RS2. 
(4)	If there exists a Sj (1j p) such that Sj = , then make each point in RS null and jump to step (9). For each existence qualifier , if each existence qualifier's corresponding range formula Sj is equal to , then replace the formu-la within the scope of each existence qualifier with Boolean constant F. For each universal qualifier , if each universal qualifier's corresponding range formula Sj is equal to , then replace the formula within the scope of each universal qualifier with Boolean constant T. 
The replacement is based on the following two facts: 
(a)	If Sj = , then (Sj) = p(pSj  ) = p(F  ) = F. 
(b)	If Sj = , then (Sj) = p(pSj  ) = p(T  ) = T. 
(5)	Transform V to V's prenex disjunctive normal form V'. Assume that its prenex disjunctive normal form V' has q quantifiers ( or ) and let each quantifier in its prenex disjunctive normal form V' be denoted as Qj (1j q) from left to right and the range formula associated with Qj (1j q) be Sp+j. For example, V = (RS1(p1))(p1[Xi]’2000’)  (RS2(p2)) (p2[Xj]’male’) can be transformed into V’ = (RS1(p1) (RS2(p2)) (p1[Xi]’2000’  p2[Xj]’male’). Each of the conjunctive clauses of its prenex disjunctive normal form V' will be denoted as Pi (1i n). For each Pi (1 i n) do step (6). 
(6)	Construct a WFF over p, S1  Sp  Q1+p(S1+p(p1+p) Qq(Sq(pq))(Pi), for each Pi (1in). Without the loss of generality, we suppose that p, S1 is the range formula of p. Let Q1+p(S1+p(p1+p) Qq(Sq(pq))(Pi) be denoted as Vi. For each U1  Up  Vi (1i n), do the following steps. 
(6.1)	Form the defining equation RSi = S1  ...  Sp+q. 
(6.2)	Pi consists of the conjunction of a series of coordinate formu-las, set formulas and cardinality formulas. For resource space RSi, execute the selection operation on the restrictions Pi: F(RSi)={p | pRSi  Pi}. The result of the selection operation is denoted as RSi’. 
(7)	Merge all the resource spaces RSi' (1i n) and the result is denoted as RS'. 
(8)	For any Qj (1j  q) and the resource space Sj+p in the resource space Sj+p's corresponding range formula, we use RS'.X* and Sj+p.X* to denote the sets of all axes of RS’ and Sj+p respectively. 
For j from q to 1, do the following iteration: 
RS' = RS'.X*  Sj+p.X*RS'			if Qj= 
RS' = RS'[Sj+p.X*]Sj+p			if Qj= 
After q step operations on RS', the eventual result is denoted as RS''. Then do the following transformation: 
RS'' = S1  RS(RS'') 
Resource space RS'' is exactly the result resource space that one of the conjunctive clauses in step (2) desires. 
(9)	Merge all the resource spaces that all conjunctive clauses in step (2) produce through step (3) to step (8). The result resource space will be exactly the result resource space the original alpha expression desires. 
Theorem 4.5. For any alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): , after the above transformation any point satisfying  will appear in the result re-source space and none of the points making  false will be in the result resource space. 
Proof. For alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): , we first construct RS as the target resource space according to X1, X2, ..., and Xn. It is obvious that the target resource space is a subset of RS. That is any point alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): making  true appears in RS. So transform  to ’=RS(p)   and then alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): will be transformed into p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): ’. After step (1) and step (2) in transform, alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): will be transformed into alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn):'s dis-junctive normal form involving m pieces of conjunctive clauses (WFFs over alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn):). 
If p satisfies , we will prove that after the transformation p still exists in the result resource space. Since p makes ’ true, there at least exists one conjunctive clause of ’ that p satisfies. Let one conjunctive clause of ’ that p satisfies be U1  Up  V. After step (3), (4) and (5) of the transformation, one conjunctive clause of ’ that p satisfies will become S1  Sp  Q1(S1+p(p1+p)Qq(Sq+p(pq+p))(P1  P2  … Pn), where Qj (1jq) repre-sents qualifies ( or ) and Q1(S1+p(p1+p)Qq(Sq+p(pq+p))(P1  P2  … Pn) is the prenex disjunctive normal form of V. After step (6) and (7), we can get the resource space RS' corresponding to the above conjunctive clause U1  Up  V.  In step (8), we suppose that after the iteration from Qq to Qj+1, the resource space RS' corresponding to the above conjunctive clause U1  Up  V. is transformed into RS’tmp and p is still in RS’tmp. Now, we will prove that after Qj p still exists in the result resource space. 
a)	We firstly suppose that Qj is an existence qualifier . Since p is still in RS’tmp, there at least exist one point p’ in Sp+j such that there will exist a point p” in RS’tmp the projection of which on RS.X* is p and the projection on Sp+j.X* is p’. So point p”[RS'.X*  Sj+p.X*] also ap-pears in the resource space RS'.X*  Sj+p.X*RS’tmp. 
b)	Then we suppose that Qj is a universal qualifier . Since Qj is a uni-versal qualifier, for any point p’ in Sp+j there will exist a point p” in RS’tmp such that the projection of p” on RS.X* is p and the projection of p” on Sp+j.X* is p’. So point p”[RS'.X*  Sj+p.X*] also appears in the resource space RS’tmp[Sj+p.X*]Sj+p. 
From a) and b), we can conclude that after step (8) of the transfor-mation there at least exists one point p” in RS” such that the projection of one point p” in RS” on RS.X* is p. So one point p” in RS” will appear in the final result resource space RS. 
Similarly, we can prove that any point making  false will not be in the result resource space.  
The Resource Space Calculus proposed above has the following differ-ence from the relational calculus (Codd, 1972). 
1.	The resource space calculus has different operational objectives with the relational calculus. The operational objectives in The resource space calculus includes resource space, axis, coordinate, point and resource-entry which represent different classification granularity of resources, while the relational calculus takes table, tuple, attribute and atomic value as the basic operational units. 
2.	In the relational calculus, there exists only one type of value-based comparison formulas called join terms. On the other hand, there ex-ist three types of comparison formulas coordinate formula, cardi-nality formula and set formula. Herein, coordinate formula and cardi-nality formula is value-based comparison formulas and set formula is set-based comparison formula. Richer semantics can be expressed by the resource space calculus. 
3.	The resource space calculus is used to express totally different se-mantics from the relational calculus. The classification semantics among resources can be efficiently expressed by using the Resource Space Model. As a basic element, a point in The resource space calculus is used to represent a class of resources. In the relational calculus, a tuple is used to represent just a single resource (a record).
