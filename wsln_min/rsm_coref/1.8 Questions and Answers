Question 1. We have the relational database model and many commercial database systems.  Do we still need Resource Space Model?   
Answer 1. Different models have different application scopes. The rela-tional database model is useful in many applications, especially in pure data management.  The Resource Space Model aims at managing con-tents of various resources rather than pure data.  
Question 2. What are the distinguished characteristics of the Resource Space Model compared with existing data models.  
Answer 2. The Resource Space Model is based on content classification reflecting human classification commonsense and thinking on recogniz-ing real-world objects. Coordinates at each axis are discrete and any coor-dinate can be a tree strucuture.  Using the multi-dimensional index, The Resource Space Model supports efficient searching. 
Question 3. Resource Space Model designers may not clearly know the classification of resources. For example, some cross-area book could be-long to two categories. 
Answer 3.  The Resource Space Model is good at managing the content that can be clearly classified.  Designers can design resource spaces of dif-ferent normal forms according to different applications. The following approaches can be used to deal with this issue:  
1.	add undetermined coordinates to specify those un-determined re-sources;  
2.	add a cross-class coordinate to appropriate axis;  
3.	introduce fuzzy theory to establish a fuzzy Resource Space Model as introduced in (Zhuge, 2004c); and,  
4.	introduce probability into Resource Space Model to reflect the proba-bility world (see chapter 9). 
Question 4. Can Resource Space Model change structure during use?  
Answer 4. The original Resource Space Model is designed for specific ap-plications just like databases, so it is inappropriate to change structure af-ter design.  On the other hand, the normal form would be damaged if we change the structure of The original Resource Space Model.  There are two ways to resolve this issue.  One is that we can design a more stable resource space since diverse resource spaces can be designed for an application.  The second is that we can design a Resource Space Model system that can adapt to change. 
Question 5. Can we use existing database systems to realize a resource space system? 
Answer 5. Existing data structure and indexing techniques can be used to implement a resource space system. The XML file can be used as the in-termediate of storing resources. However, a special approach that makes use of the characteristics of the Resource Space Model is needed.  Chap-ter 6 presents an approach to the storage of resource space. 
Question 6. Are resources stored in the resource space? 
Answer 6. A resource space includes three parts: the structure of A resource space including axes and axes's coordinates, the specification of the con-tent (including identity, path and semantic description) of resources, and the entity resources.  The strategy of storing three parts depends on the resource space system.   Based on the Resource Space Model, different types of resource space systems can be developed. 
Question 7. What is the relationship between the Resource Space Model and the Knowledge Grid? 
Answer 7. The original idea of the Knowledge Grid is for effective knowledge sharing (Zhuge, 2002). Semantics is the basis for knowledge sharing. The Resource Space Model is suitable for managing knowledge resources by knowledge classification, for example, (concept, relation, ax-iom, rules, method and theory) can be one axis, and discipline can be an-other axis of a knowledge space.  A decentralized Resource Space Model can be the underlying infrastructure of the Knowledge Grid. 
Question 8. What is the relationship between the Resource Space Model and P2P networks? 
Answer 8. P2P is a scalable decentralized resource management mecha-nism.  A resource space can be either centralized or decentralized. A one-dimensional resource space can be implemented as a structured P2P net-work by partitioning a set of resources and enabling a peer to manage a class of resources.  Semantic locality requires resources of the same class to be stored in the same place or close places and managed by one peer.  It is an interesting issue to realize efficient routing in a multi-dimensional P2P resource space.  Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 present two solutions to construct P2P resource spaces.
