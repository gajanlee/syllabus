The Join, Disjoin, Merge and Split operations on the probabilistic Re-source Space Model can be defined by using the membership probability function. 
Join. Let |RS| be the number of the dimensions of the RS. If two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 store the same type of resources and have k common axes, then two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 can be joined together as one resource space RS such that two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 RS2 share k common axes and |RS|=|RS1| + |RS2|  k. For any resource r, we have: 
1.	r belongs to RS if and only if r belongs to both RS and RS2; 
2.	For any common axis Xi in RS1 and RS2 and any coordinate C on any common axis Xi in RS1 and RS2, let r, r’ and r” be the membership probability function of r at any common axis Xi in RS1 and RS2 in RS1, RS1 and RS2 respectively. Then r(C) = r’(C) + (1)r”(C), 01; 
3.	For any non-common axis Xj in RS1 and any coordinate C’ at any non-common axis Xj in RS1, let r and r’ be the membership probability function of r at any non-common axis Xj in RS1 in RS and RS1 respectively. If there exists a common axis Xi such that XjXi, then r(C’)=r’(C’) ( / ), where ri and ri’ are the membership probability functions of r at any non-common axis Xj in RS1 in RS and RS1 respectively. Otherwise, r(C’)=r’(C’). 
Disjoin. A resource space RS can be disjoined into two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 that store the same type of resources as that of A resource space RS such that two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 that store the same type of resources as that of RS such that they have k common axes have k common axes, and |RS|=|RS1| + |RS2|  k. For any resource r, we have: 
1.	r belongs to both RS1 and RS2 if and only if r belongs to RS; 
2.	For any axis Xi in RS1 and any coordinate C on any axis Xi in RS1, let r and r’ be the membership probability functions of r on any axis Xi in RS1 in RS1 and RS1 respectively, then r(C)= r’(C). 
Merge. If two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 store the same type of resources and satisfy: 1) |RS1|=|RS2|=n; and, 2) two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 have n1 common axes, and there exist two different axes X' and X” satisfying the merge condition, then two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 can be merged into one RS by retaining n1 common axes and adding a new axis X*=X'X”. one RS is called the merge of two resource spaces RS1 and RS2RS2, denoted as RS1RS2RS, and |RS|= n. For any resource r, we have: 
1.	r belongs to RS if and only if r belongs to either RS1 or RS2; 
2.	For any common axis Xi and any coordinate C at any common axis Xi, let r, r’ and r” be the membership probability functions of r at any common axis Xi in RS, RS1 and RS2 respectively. If r belongs to RS, RS1 and RS2RS1 RS2, then r(C) = r’(C) + (1)r”(C), 01. Otherwise, r(C) = r’(C) if r belongs to RS1, or r(C) = r”(C) if r belongs to RS2; 
3.	Let C, C’ and C” be any coordinates such that CX'X”, C’X'X” and C” X”X'. And let r, r’ and C” be the membership probability functions of r at X*, X' and X”in RS, RS1 and RS2 respectively. If r belongs to RS, RS1 and RS2RS1 RS2, then r(C) = r’(C) + (1)r”(C), r(C’) = r’(C’) and r(C”) = r”(C”). Otherwise, r(C) = r’(C), r(C’) = r’(C’) and r(C”) = 0 if r belongs to RS1, or r(C) = r”(C), r(C’) = 0 and r(C”) = r”(C”) if r belongs to RS2. 
Split. A resource space RS can be split into two resource spaces RS1 and RS2 that store the same type of resources as A resource space RS and have |RS|1 common axes by splitting an axis X into two: X’ and X, such that X=X’X. For any resource r, we have: 
1.	r belongs to both RS1 and RS2, if and only if r belongs to RS; 
2.	For any axis Xi (1in) in RS1 and any coordinate C at Xi, let r and r’ be the membership probability functions of r at Xi in RS and RS1 respectively, then r(C)= r’(C).
