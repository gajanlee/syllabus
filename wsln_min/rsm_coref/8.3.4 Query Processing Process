Before sending a query, the peer needs to compare a query with the peer's in-dex on resources, and then adopts different mechanisms to gossip queries by making use of the neighbor lists at different levels.  In most applica-tions, the resources a peer possesses reflect a peer's interests, and the queries from a peer would be similar to its interests with high probability.  In this situation, the query could be answered in the community the query-initiator belongs to, and only the neighbor list at the lowest level is need-ed for the query processing.  While the query fits the other level, the query is routed to that appropriate category, and a gossip process initiates there. When the query corresponds to more than one level, several gossip pro-cesses take place in parallel in the corresponding categories.  The top-k correlative categories are selected to make trade-off between the whole network cost and the acceptable results. 
Hamming distance dist(α1, α2) between vectors α1 and α2 in a discrete data space is the number of dimensions on which the corresponding components of vectors α1 and α2 are different (Qian et al., 2006).  The distance between a vector α=(a1, a2, …, ad) and a discrete rectangle S=S1×S2×…×Sd can be defined as:  
dist(α, S) =  , where f(ai, Si) =     .  
The distance measures how many components of vector α are not con-tained in the corresponding component sets of rectangle S.  In Resource Space Model, Si corresponds to a specified coordinate set of the ith axis. 
Haming distance is suitable for measuring distance in multidimension-al non-ordered discrete data space, which is regarded as the correlative metric between query and the categories.
