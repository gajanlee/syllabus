A more general definition of fine classification in the probabilistic Resource Space Model is given as follows: 
Definition 9.3. Let X={C1, C2, …, Cn} be an axis and C’ be a coordinate at another axis X’, we say that X finely classifies C’ (denoted as C’/X) if and only if for any resource r: 
1.	Prob(r(R(C’)R(Ci))  r(R(C’)R(Cj)) = 0 for 1ijn; and, 
2.	Prob(rR(C’)) =   hold.  
According to definition 9.3 and the total probability theorem, coordi-nate C’ can be finely classified by axis X if and only if the probability of resource r belonging to R(C’) can be partitioned into the probabilities of resource r belonging to R(C’)R(C1), R(C’)R(C2), ... and R(C’)R(Cn) respective-ly. 
For two axes X={C1, C2, …, Cn} and X’={C1’, C2’, …, Cm’}, X={C1 finely classifies X’ (i.e., X’/X) if and only if X={C1 finely classifies C1’, C2’, …, and Cm’. two axes X={C1, C2, …, Cn} and X’={C1’, C2’, …, Cm’} are called orthogonal with each other (i.e., XX’) if both X’/X and X/X’ hold. 
Definition 9.4. A probabilistic resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) satisfies the third normal form of the Resource Space Model if for any two axes Xi and Xj (1ijn) in A probabilistic resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn), XiXj holds. 
In the Probabilistic Resource Space Model, for any given 3NF resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn), the following constraints should be satisfied: 
Theorem 9.2. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a probabilistic resource space sat-isfying 3NF. For any two axes Xi and Xj (1i, jn) and resource r in a probabilistic resource space sat-isfying 3NF,   =  holds. 
Proof. Since RS satisfies 3NF, coordinate C at axis Xi can be finely classi-fied by axis Xj. So Prob(rR(C)) =  holds. Thus  = holds. On the other hand, coordinate C’ at axis Xj can be finely classified by axis Xi, Prob(rR(C’)) =   holds. Thus  =  holds. Therefore   =  holds. 
   Theorem 9.2 indicates that for any two axes Xi and Xj of a resource space satisfying 3NF, the probability of resource r belonging to Xi is equal to the probability of resource r belonging to Xj. 
Theorem 9.3. Let RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) be a 3NF probabilistic resource space. For any axis Xi (1in) and any coordinate C at any axis Xi (1in), Prob(rR(C))＝  holds, where p represents a point in RS and p[Xi] is the projection of p at any axis Xi (1in).  
Proof. Let T be the union of all points whose projections on Xi are C. So R(T) = R(C)   . Since resource space RS satisfies 3NF, any two points in resource space RS are independent of each other. So we have Prob(rR(T)) = . On the other hand, Prob(rR(T))=Prob(r(R(C) )) = Prob(r(R(C)   )) holds. Since coordinate C can be finely classified by axis Xj (1jin), R(C) is a subclass of R(Xj). So Prob(rR(T)) = Prob(r(R(C) )) = Prob(rR(C)) holds. Therefore Prob(rR(C))＝  holds.
