A great variety of query languages can be designed for operating resource spaces. But how many operations are complete or necessary? How to de-fine “complete” or “necessary” formally? This chapter answers these questions by investigating the theoretical basis for determining how com-plete a selection capability is provided in a proposed resource sublanguage independently of any host language. The results are very useful to the de-sign and analysis of the operating languages of the Resource Space Model.
