When a peer r wants to depart the system, the following method keeps the peers in a peer r inView and those in a peer r's outView connected.   
For each peer (take peer s for example) in its outView, its selects one peer ID (q for example) from its's inView randomly, then forms a failure message including one peer ID (q for example) and forwards a failure message including q to s.  When peer s receives a failure message including q, peer s substitutes its ID(r) with one peer ID (q for example) in its inView, then forwards a message with its and q.  When one peer ID (q for example) receives a message, one peer ID (q for example) updates râ€™s ID(r) with peer s in its inView.  So in this way, the withdrawal behavior of a pivot peer does not lead to the partition of the whole network. 
When a peer crashes without notifying other peers, the peers detect crashes by interchanging the peers's states periodically. If no response within a certain period elapsed is returned from one of its neighbors, its regards its as being crashed and removes its from the corresponding view (Renesse et al, 1998). 
Peer departure reduces the size of a community. It is necessary to merge communities in the same parent category if an existing communi-ty is small.  The following is the approach to merge communities: 
If the size of community p becomes small, community p needs to coalesce with another community, and community p should find community p's siblings in the partition tree first.  If its siblings are also leaves of the partition tree and the number of its siblings is one (q, for example), then coalesce community p and q, make p and q's direct parent a leaf, and assign the coalesced commu-nity to a leaf. If the number of its siblings is larger than one, then se-lect one leaf that has the least load and coalesce with the selected com-munity. 
If the siblings of the community p are not the leaves of the partition tree, perform the depth-first search in the sub-tree of the partition tree rooted at one of the sub-tree of the partition tree rooted at one of its siblings (e.g., q)'s siblings (e.g., q) until the leaves (e.g., r) of the sub-tree of the partition tree rooted at one of its siblings (e.g., q) are reached, and then merge the two communities the community p and the community p into one.
