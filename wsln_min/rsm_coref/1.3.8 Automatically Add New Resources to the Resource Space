A resource has external feature and internal feature.  internal feature reflects the content of resources.  The external feature helps distinguish one resource from the other resources.  Usually internal feature is not easy to be accurately obtained or expressed, while the external features can be accurately captured.  
There could be no intersection between the external feature and the in-ternal feature.  For example, the publication date does not reflect the con-tent of a paper. 
A resource space represents the designer’s viewpoint of classification on resources.  If A resource space's user has stored some resources in A resource space, the re-source space containing resources also reflects the designer’s viewpoint of classification on resources.  Such classification viewpoint can help classify new resources. 
The approach to automatically adding resources to resource space var-ies with the features of resources. To automatically add new papers to resource space depends on the comparison between the external features and internal features of the new paper and the features of the point.  
The keywords of papers in a point of the existing resource space repre-sent authors’ viewpoint on the classifications of the contents of papers.  Information such as the publisher and the publication type (journal or proceeding) available from the publishers’ website is the external feature. 
The following process helps add new papers to the paper resource space. 
1.	Extract keywords from the papers in every point of the resource space, and unite a point p’s keyword set with a point p’s's coordinates to form a set Kp.  An empty point Kp only consists of the coordinates of p. Information retrieval techniques like TF-IDF can help find im-portant words in text (Salton, 1989; Salton, 1991). 
2.	Extract the keywords from the new paper and put the keywords into set KI representing the internal features. 
3.	Obtain the external features about the new paper such as journal name, publisher, publishing date and impact factor, and put the external features about the new paper such as journal name, publisher, publishing date and impact factor into set KE.  The main external features are usually available from the metadata of journals. 
4.	Unite the external features and the internal features on the new pa-per K=KIKE.  
5.	For every point p in the space, compare K with Kp, if K can best match Kp according to some criteria (e.g., share a certain number of keywords in the meaning of domain ontology), the paper is likely to match the point and therefore put the paper into the point, oth-erwise put the paper into the candidate pool awaiting additional techniques. 
The citation relation reflects a kind of content inheritance relation. The citing and cited papers in the known classification can help determine the classification of a paper. If a paper in a point is cited by or cites the new paper, then the two papers probably belong to the same category.  The more papers in a point cite or are cited by the new paper, the higher prob-ability of the new paper belongs to a point. 
We observed two phenomena from experiments of using TF-IDF to ex-tract keywords and match the new paper and the point:  
1.	The more resources evenly distributed in the resource space, the bet-ter the effect of automatically adding new resources to the resource space; and,  
2.	The best effect (approximately 80%) can be reached when the weight of the external features reaches 90%.   
That is to say, the external features play a more important role.
