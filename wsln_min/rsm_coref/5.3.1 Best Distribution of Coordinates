First we give the following theorem: 
Theorem 5.2. Given a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and every Xi's coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. Let N be the number of points in a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and its coordinates are unsorted in alphabet and |Xi| be the number of coordinates on axis Xi, n be fixed dimension and every |Xi| be variable. Assume that the number of comparisons for any comparison-based algorithm for searching Q(X1=q1, , Xn=qn) in a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and its coordinates are unsorted in alphabet must do at least in the worst case is W(n). Then, Min W(n)= , and only when |X1| = |X2| = …= |Xn|, this minimum can be reached. 
Proof. Given any class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), according to theorem 5.1, W(n)=  . Because the space dimension n is fixed, we only need to find the minimum of   under the con-straint:  . According to the Mean Inequalities [R. P. Agarwal, Difference Equations and Inequalities, 2nd edition, CRC, 2000]:   xi 0, 1i n, (and the equality holds only when x1= x2= …= Xn), so we have:  . Replace every xi with |Xi|, we can get:  , which can con-clude that Min W(n)= , and only when |X1| = |X2| = … = |Xn|, the minimum can be reached.  
Theorem 5.2 shows that if the space dimension keep fixed, then when the distribution of coordinates on every axis is the most even, the search-ing complexity in the worst case is the least, i.e., in the above example the distribution (2, 2, 2) is the best. It is worth to note that for some N and the space dimension, the lower bound   can never be reached. For example, given N=8 and n=4, the best distribution (2, 2, 2) cannot be reached. And for N=12 and space dimension n=3, no matter what the distribution of coordinates is, the minimum in the theorem cannot be reached. This means that only when the given N and some N satisfy some conditions, the theorem would hold.  The following corollary gives some conditionsthe given N and n . 
Corollary 5.2. Given a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and every Xi's coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. Let N be the number of points in a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and its coordinates are unsorted in alphabet and |Xi| be the number of coordinates on axis Xi, n be fixed dimension and every |Xi| be variable. Assume that the number of comparisons for any comparison-based algorithm to find a point Q(X1=q1, , Xn=qn) in a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and its coordinates are unsorted in alphabet must do at least in the worst case is W(n). Then Min W(n)= , and this minimum can be reached if and only if n  lgN and   is an integer. 
Proof. (1) Suppose n  lgN and   is an integer. Let  =S, accord-ing to n  lgN, we get   2, i.e., S  2. Now we only need to let |X1| = |X2| = … = |Xn|=S, then the lower bound in theorem 5.2 can be reached. 
(2) Suppose the lower bound can be reached, then according to theorem 5.2, |X1| = |X2| = … = |Xn|, let the value be S, from   we get N=Sn, then  =S is an integer. Because N >1, S cannot be 1, then S  2, N  2n, we can get n  lgN. So now both n  lgN and   is an inte-ger hold. 
