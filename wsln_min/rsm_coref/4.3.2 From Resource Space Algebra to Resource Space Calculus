Each operation in the resource space algebra can be represented by a piece of alpha expression in the resource space calculus. Thus, we can draw the conclusion that the resource space calculus has at least as powerful query capability as the resource space algebra. The following is the alpha ex-pressions corresponding to each operation in the resource space algebra. 
Union. RS1RS2  {p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): RS1(p)  RS2(p)}. This alpha ex-pression means that each point in the new resource space of RS1RS2 is the union of the corresponding point in RS1(p and RS1RS2. 
Intersection. RS1RS2  {p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): RS1(p)  RS2(p)}. This alpha expression means that each point in the new resource space of RS1RS2 is the intersection of the corresponding point in RS1(p and RS1RS2. 
Difference. RS1RS2  {p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): RS1(p)  RS2(p)}. This alpha expression means that each point in the new resource space of RS1RS2 is the difference operation on the corresponding point in RS1 and RS2(p. 
Cartesian product. RS1RS2  {p(X1, X2, ..., Xn, Y1, ... Ym): (RS1(p1))(RS2(p2))(p[X1]=p1[X1] ... p[Xn]=p1[Xn]  p[Y1]=p2[Y1] ... p[Ym]=p2[Ym])}. This alpha expression means that the axes of the new resource space of RS1RS2 are the concatenation of the axes of RS1 and RS1RS2. And each point in RS1RS2 is the concatenation of the corresponding points in RS1 and RS2. 
Join. RS1RS2  {p(X1, …, Xm, Y1, …, Yn, Z1, …,Zk): (RS1(p1)) (RS2(p2)) (p[X1]=p1[X1] ... p[Xm]=p1[Xm]  p[Y1]=p1[Y1]=p2[Y1] ... p[Yn]=p1[Y1]=p2[Yn]  p[Z1]=p2[Z1]  ...  p[Zk]=p2[Zk])}. This alpha ex-pression means that the axes of the new resource space of RS1RS2 are the union of the axes of RS1(p1 and RS1RS2. And each point in RS1RS2 is the con-catenation of the corresponding points in RS1 and RS2 without duplicate axes. 
Disjoin. RS(X1, ..., Xt)  {p(X1, ..., Xt): (RS(p1))(p[X1]=p1[X1] ...  p[Xt]=p1[Xt])}. This alpha expression means that the axes X1, ..., and Xt of the new resource space is a subset of the axes of RS. For each point p in the new resource space, p is non-null if and only if there exists one point p1 in RS such that p and one point p1 in RS have the same projection on the axes X1, ..., and Xt of the new resource space. 
Merge. RS(X1, ..., Xn, XY)  {p(X1, ..., Xn, XY): (RS1(p1))(p[X1]=p1[X1] ...  p[Xn]=p1[Xn]  p[XY]=p1[X])  (RS2(p2))(p[X1]=p2[X1] ...  p[Xn]=p2[Xn]  p[XY]=p2[Y])}. This al-pha expression means that the first n axes of the new resource space are the same as RS1 and RS2 and the (n+1)th axis is the merge of the (n+1)th axes of RS1 and RS2RS2. Each point in the new resource space is the union of the corresponding point in RS1 and RS2RS2. 
Split. RS(X1, ..., Xn, X[C])  {p(X1, ..., Xn, X[C]): (RS(p1))(p[X1]=p1[X1] ...  p[Xn]=p1[Xn]  p[X[C]]=p1[X])}, herein C represents a set of coor-dinates. This alpha expression means that the first n axes of the new re-source space are the same as RS and the coordinate set C of the (n+1)th axis is a subset of that of the (n+1)th axes of RS. Any point in the new re-source space comes from RS. 
Selection. F(RS(X1, X2, ..., Xn))  {p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): RS(p)  (F  F)  F}. This alpha expression means that each point in the new resource space should make F true. 
Division. RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C)  {p(A): (RS2(p2)) (RS1(p1)) (p[A]=p1[A]  p2[B]=p1[B])}, herein A=X1, …, Xm, B=Y1, …, Yt and C=Z1, …, Zn. This alpha expression means that the axes of the new re-source space of RS1(A, B)[]RS2(B, C) are axis list A. For any point p’ in the new resource space, any point p’ in the new resource space is non-null if and only if for any non-null point p in RS2(p2 there exists a non-null point p in A such that p’[A]=p[A] and p [B]=p[B].
