The idea of deploying the resource space onto P2P systems is to divide the resource space into many small zones.  Each node manages one zone of the resource space.  
The structured P2P RSM is efficient and stable in distributed environ-ment. For a n-dimensional space partitioned into m equal zones, the aver-age routing path length is (n/4)(m1/n) and individual nodes maintain 2n neighborsâ€™ information. These scaling results mean that, for a n-dimensional space, the increase of the number of nodes (i.e., the increase of the number of zones) does not lead to the increase of per node state, while the path length grows with O(m1/n).  
The routing performance is further improved by considering the under-lying network IP topology and adding long links. Thus for time-sensitive applications, they can gain lower time cost by sacrificing some spaces. A timer-based failure recovery mechanism is proposed for stability. A timer-based failure recovery mechanism can also deal with the coordinate tree.  
The structured P2P RSM provides a decentralized, efficient and stable storage infrastructure for the Resource Space Model.
