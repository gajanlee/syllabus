The Semantic Web is to improve the World Wide Web by extending HTML Web pages to descriptions with machine-understandable seman-tics, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation (Bern-ers-Lee et al., 2001; Heflin and Hendler, 2001).  The success of HTML guides researchers to develop more powerful markup languages like the Resource Description Framework (RDF, www.w3c.org/RDF), which is often used to integrate various applications by using the eXten-sible Markup Language (XML) for syntax and URIs for naming (www.w3c.org/XML). 
Grid computing research influences the development of the Semantic Web from the computing ideal, infrastructure and model aspects (Foster, 2000, www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/~foster/). Artificial intelligence research influ-ences the development of the Semantic Web towards a wisdom Web (Ho-schek et al, 2000; Zhong et al, 2002). 
Knowledge representation and logics are the basis of traditional artificial intelligence.  To introduce rules and description logics into the Semantic Web is a natural idea to enable the Semantic Web to support intelligent applications.  An appropriate representation of semantics is also the key to solve the service discovery and matching issues in the service-oriented computing. 
To find a good representation approach is only one aspect of realizing the Semantic Web.  Cross-domain understanding needs domain ontology. However, how to efficiently organize, use and maintain the semantic content is a major challenge to realize an efficient Semantic Web. 
Relational Data Base Model is a semantic model to effectively organize and manage attribute-value semantics (Chen, 1976; Codd, 1970; Codd, 1971b). With the normal form theories, Relational Data Base Model ensures the efficiency and ac-curacy of operations on data (Mok, 2002; Ullman, 1988; William, 1983). But the function dependence relationship between attributes of objects and the relationship between attributes and values are limited in semantic ability to organize and manage versatile resources in a large-scale dynam-ic interconnection environment.  
Object-oriented databases and object-relational databases extend the application scope of the relational databases by borrowing the advantages of the object-oriented methodologies and programming languages like inheritance and encapsulation to enable complex objects to be normally managed (Abiteboul et al, 1995; Kim, 1990; Rumbaugh et al., 1991; Ullman, 1988). Several graph-based semantic models built on the tradi-tional hierarchical and network data models have been proposed (Gyssens et al, 1994; Levene and Loizou, 1995; Levene and Poulovassilis, 1990; Poulovassilis and Levene, 1994). But, Several graph-based semantic models built on the tradi-tional hierarchical and network data models are incapable of effectively managing heterogeneous, distributed and ocean resources in a large, open and dynamic network environment. Semantic rich data mod-els are required for achieving the efficiency and efficacy of resource man-agement in the future interconnection environment. 
Human recognizes the objective world by classifying objects, establish-ing links between known objects, and discovering clues between known and unknown objects. Orthogonal classification is a way to normalize the classification of resources.  For example, people are used to finding books in library by classifications on topics, publishers, or alphabets, which are orthogonal with each other. If classifications on topics, publishers, or alphabets, which are orthogonal with each other are integrated into one classification model as shown in Fig. 2.1, then people can locate a book by given three coordinates of corresponding axes in the three-dimensional classification space.  Locating resources will be more efficient than only use one type of classification or separately use classifications on topics, publishers, or alphabets, which are orthogonal with each other.  Further, semantic links like citation relationships (e.g., “The Knowledge Grid” cites “Weav-ing the Web” as shown in Fig. 2.1) and common-author relationships can be established between books  the entries in nodes.  The incorporation of the classification semantics with the link semantics can form a richer semantic image (overlay) for locating resources. 
The Resource Space Model RSM is a semantic data model for uniform-ly, normally and effectively specifying and managing resources by nor-malizing classification semantics (Zhuge, 2004a).  The Resource Space Model RSM's theoretical basis is the normal forms and integrity constraints on resources (Zhuge et al., 2005c).   
The characteristic of the Resource Space Model is the normalization on classification semantics. 
Semantic Link Network SLN is a semantic model that links resource descriptions by semantic links (Zhuge, 2003). Semantic Link Network SLN supports semantic representation, reasoning, execution, referential search, and normalization. An SLN can represent any semantic relationships between resources.  
The characteristic of the SLN is the SLN's autonomy: any node (resource) can link to any semantic relevant node. 
Are there any intrinsic rules between RSM and SLN? To know any intrinsic rules between RSM and SLN can better develop the theory of the semantic overlay for the future interconnection environment.
