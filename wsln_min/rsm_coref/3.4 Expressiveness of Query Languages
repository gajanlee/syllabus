The expressiveness of query languages is an abstract concept, The expressiveness of query languages is diffi-cult to be defined or depicted accurately. Here we have not defined the expressiveness of operations directly, we just study the comparison be-tween expressiveness and some characteristics of the comparison be-tween expressiveness. For example, we want to answer questions like: given two operation languages, whose ex-pressiveness is stronger? Or for two given operations P and Q, whose ex-pressiveness is stronger?
