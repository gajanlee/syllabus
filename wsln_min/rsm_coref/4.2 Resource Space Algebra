Query operations on a given resource space may result in only some de-sirable points, but only some de-sirable points cannot be operated further by Query operations on a given resource space. To guarantee the query result to be a resource space, the following mechanism is employed. Any opera-tion will result in a certain resource space and all undesired points in a certain resource space will be maintained and marked as null points in-stead of being filtered out and all desired points marked as non-null points. 
In the following discussion, R(p) denotes the resources that point p can contain and R(p) denotes the resources that point p actually contains. In a resource space RS, for any null point p we have R(p)=, R(p)= and pRS. For axis X¬i and point p in RS, p[Xi] is used to denote the projection of point p on axis X¬i. 
Two resource spaces RS1(X1, X2 … Xn) and RS2(Y1, Y2 … Yn) are union-compatible if Two resource spaces RS1(X1, X2 … Xn) have the same schema, i.e. X1=Y1, …, Xn=Yn. Let p1 and p2 be two points in Two resource spaces RS1(X1, X2 … Xn) Xnrespectively. If p1[Xi]=p2[Xi] for 1in holds, then we say that p1 has the same coordinates with p2, denot-ed as p1 =p¬ p2.
