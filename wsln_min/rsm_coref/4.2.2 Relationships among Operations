Given a resource space RS, the following situation often occurs: there usually exist some resource-entries (for example r) and points (for exam-ple p) in a resource space RS such that rR(p) but rR(p). 
In Fig. 4.3(a), there exists a resource-entry id1 to appear in both point p1 and point p2 (3NF is not satisfied in this case). So we can conclude that rR(a1) from rR(p1) and rR(b2) from r R(p2). So rR(p3) but rR(p3). An issue of this situation is that a user could not obtain the re-source-entry r when users only query point p2. 
To solve this issue, we suppose that all resource spaces satisfy the fol-lowing restriction.  For any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn), any point p in any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn) and any resource r, rR(p) holds if and only if there exist n points p1, p2, …, and pn in any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn) such that both rR(pi) and p[Xi]=pi[Xi] hold for any 1in. 
Theorem 4.1. For any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn) satisfying the above restriction, RS(X1, …, Xn)=(X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS holds. 
Proof. It is clear that the resource space RS and the resource space (X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS have the same schema. For any point p in the resource space RS and p’ in (X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS such that p =p p’, we will prove that p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null, and that Rp)=Rp’) holds. (1) If p is non-null, then there exist n non-null points p1, p2, …, pn in X1(RS, X2(RS), …, Xn(RS) respectively such that p[Xi] = pi[Xi] hold for any 1in. So there exists a non-null point p in X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS) such that p =p p. Since both p and p are non-null, p’ is non-null point. It is obvious that if p is a null point then p’ is also a null point. So p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null. (2) Since the resource space RS satisfies the given restriction, for any resource r if rR(p) holds then there exists at least one axis Xi (1in) in the resource space RS such that rR(p[Xi]). So for the resource space RS, rR(p[Xi]). Since p[Xi]=p’[Xi] holds, rR(p[Xi]) holds. Thus rR(p’) holds. On the other hand, if rR(p) holds, we can easily conclude that rR(p’) holds. So Rp)=Rp’) holds. Thus RS(X1, …, Xn)=(X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS holds. Proof. It is clear that the resource space RS and the resource space (X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS have the same schema. For any point p in the resource space RS and p’ in (X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS such that p =p p’, we will prove that p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null, and that Rp)=Rp’) holds. (1) If p is non-null, then there exist n non-null points p1, p2, …, pn in X1(RS, X2(RS), …, Xn(RS) respectively such that p[Xi] = pi[Xi] hold for any 1in. So there exists a non-null point p in X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS) such that p =p p. Since both p and p are non-null, p’ is non-null point. It is obvious that if p is a null point then p’ is also a null point. So p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null. (2) Since the resource space RS satisfies the given restriction, for any resource r if rR(p) holds then there exists at least one axis Xi (1in) in the resource space RS such that rR(p[Xi]). So for the resource space RS, rR(p[Xi]). Since p[Xi]=p’[Xi] holds, rR(p[Xi]) holds. Thus rR(p’) holds. On the other hand, if rR(p) holds, we can easily conclude that rR(p’) holds. So Rp)=Rp’) holds. Thus RS(X1, …, Xn)=(X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS holds. 
According to theorem 4.1, for any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn), the above restriction can be easily satisfied by setting any resource space RS(X1, …, Xn) as (X1(RS)  X2(RS) … Xn(RS))RS. 
Theorem 4.2. Let A=X1, …, Xm, B=Y1, …, Yt and C=Z1, …, Zn.  For any resource space RS1(A, B) and resource space RS2(B, C), RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C) = A(RS1)  (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)) holds. 
Proof. (1) Let p and p’ be two points in resource spaces RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C) and A(RS1)  (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)) respectively. We will prove that if p =p p’ holds, then p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null. Suppose that p is a null point in resource spaces RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C). Then there exits a null point p1 in RS1(A, B) and a non-null point p2 in RS2(B, C) such that p1[A]=p[A] and p1[B]=p2[B] hold. Let p3 be the point in A(RS1) having the same coordi-nates as p If p3 is null, then it is obvious that p’ is a null point. The following is the case that p3 is a non-null point in A(RS1). Let p4 be the point in A(RS1)  B(RS2) having the same coordinates as p. Since p3 and p2 in B(RS2) are non-null points, p4 is a non-null point. Since p is a null point in A(RS1, the point p1’ in A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1 satisfying p1 =p p1’ is also a null point. Let p5 be the point in (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)) having the same coor-dinates as p. So p5 is also a non-null point. Since both p3 and p5 are non-null point, p’ is a null point. (2) In the same way, we can prove that p’ is also a non-null point when p is a non-null point. Proof. (1) Let p and p’ be two points in resource spaces RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C) and A(RS1)  (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)) respectively. We will prove that if p =p p’ holds, then p is non-null if and only if p’ is non-null. Suppose that p is a null point in resource spaces RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C). Then there exits a null point p1 in RS1(A, B) and a non-null point p2 in RS2(B, C) such that p1[A]=p[A] and p1[B]=p2[B] hold. Let p3 be the point in A(RS1) having the same coordi-nates as p If p3 is null, then it is obvious that p’ is a null point. The following is the case that p3 is a non-null point in A(RS1). Let p4 be the point in A(RS1)  B(RS2) having the same coordinates as p. Since p3 and p2 in B(RS2) are non-null points, p4 is a non-null point. Since p is a null point in A(RS1, the point p1’ in A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1 satisfying p1 =p p1’ is also a null point. Let p5 be the point in (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)) having the same coor-dinates as p. So p5 is also a non-null point. Since both p3 and p5 are non-null point, p’ is a null point. (2) In the same way, we can prove that p’ is also a non-null point when p is a non-null point. 
Theorem 4.3. Merge, Difference, Cartesian product, Projection and Selec-tion are sufficient and necessary. And other operations can be represented as follows: 
1.	Union is the special case of Merge; 
2.	RS1RS2 = RS1  (RS1  RS2); 
3.	RS1(X1, …, Xm, Y1, …, Yt)  RS2(Y1, …, Yt, Z1, …, Zn) = X1, …, Xm, Y1, …, Yt, Z1, …, Zn(RS1  RS2); 
4.	RS(X1, …, Xn-1, X[C]) = p[X]C(RS), where C represents a set of coor-dinates; and, 
5.	RS1(A, B)[B]RS2(B, C) = A(RS1)  (A(RS1)  A(A(RS1)  B(RS2)  A(RS1)  B(RS2)  RS1)), where A=X1, …, Xm, B=Y1, …, Yt and C=Z1, …, Zn. 
Theorem 4.4. In the five basic operations (Merge, Difference, Cartesian product, Projection and Selection), Difference, Cartesian product, Projec-tion and Selection keep 1NF (the first normal form), 2NF (the second normal form) and 3NF (the third normal form) of the Resource Space Model. Merge keeps 1NF (the first normal form) and 2NF (the second normal form), but Merge does not keep 3NF. As a special Merge operation, Union keeps 1NF, 2NF and 3NF.
