Much attention has been paid to modeling uncertain data in the context of relational model and XML (eXtensible Markup Language). 
Researches on modeling relational data fall into two categories depend-ing on whether the resulting models satisfy the first normal form of the classical relational model. Models satisfying the first normal form of the classical relational model usually assume that the existence of an object is uncertain and associate probabilities with a whole tuple to indicate this type of uncertainty (Cavallo and Pittarelli, 1987; Dey and Sarkar, 1996). Notable works using non-1NF usually as-sume that the existence of an object is certain, but the attribute values of an object are uncertain (Barbara et al, 1992; Fuhr and Rolleke, 1997). So Notable works using non-1NF associate probabilities with attributes of a tuple. The above two types of probabilistic relational models have limitations. It is very diffi-cult to represent the probabilities of attribute values of an object for prob-abilistic relational models satisfying the first normal form of the classical relational model. It can lead to information loss or combinatorial explosion of tuples to specify attribute value probabili-ties using tuple probabilities. On the other hand, non-1NF probabilistic relational models are often accompanied by complicated algebras and querying mechanisms. ProbView is an attempt to overcome these two types of limitations (Lakshmanan et al, 1997). ProbView firstly trans-forms non-1NF data to non-1NF's equivalent annotated the first normal form of the classical relational model patterns, and then all manipulating and querying operations in ProbView are applied to its equivalent annotated 1NF patterns. 
Other researches on this topic also concern query answering from the view of probability and query evaluation on probabilistic database (Dalvi and Suciu, 2005; Dalvi and Suciu, 2004). A system for managing data, accuracy and lineage in an integral manner is introduced (Widom, 2005). 
ProTDB is a XML model to manage probabilistic data in XML, in which stochastic events are the existence of nodes of XML data (Nierman and Jagadish, 2002). A framework is proposed to acquire, maintain and query XML documents with incomplete information, in which order in documents and DTDs is ignored (Abiteboul et al, 2006). A full complexi-ty analysis for managing probabilistic XML data is discussed (Senellart and Abiteboul, 2007).  A probabilistic XML approach is proposed to re-solve conflicts during data integration, and the order in documents and DTDs plays an important role (Keulen et al, 2005).
