The Resource Space Model can be used to reform the HTML-based ACM Computing Classification System into a normalized 3-dimensional in-formation space: (Category, Publication, Letter) as shown in Fig.1.11.   
The space satisfies the third normal form.  The category axis contains eleven categories marked by the letters from "A" to "K", each of which corresponds to a coordinate hierarchy.  Each coordinate at The category axis corresponds to a 2-dimensional slice (Publication, Letter), so users could retrieve the required information according to the publication types and/or the alphabet sequence in the given category.  retrieve is not provided by the existing classification system.   
The Resource Space Model enables information retrieval in a 3-dimensional space.   For the purpose of raising the retrieval efficiency, we can add a new axis: topic=(methodology, theory, application, product) to refine the space.
