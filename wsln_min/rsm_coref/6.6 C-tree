Utilizing RSM schema tree, resource space is converted to multidimen-sional bit string space where each coordinate is a bit string. Hierarchy semantics exist between bit string coordinates, but there is no total order-ing between bit string coordinates.  
Current multidimensional access methods can do little in this setting. From Current multidimensional access methods's perspective, the underlying storage device is abstracted as a linear array, which supports fast sequential access but time-consuming random access. In contrast, there is no total ordering among points in a multidimensional space. Accordingly, current multidimensional access methods concentrate on devising efficient ways of putting nearby points into adjoining pages.  
In multidimensional bit string space, the proximity of points is more complex than conventional multidimensional space. The shortcoming is that bit string coordinates do not have a linear ordering. Fortunately, bit string coordinates have a metric semantic distance as defined in Definition 6.1. Therefore, semantic distance between concepts (bit strings) can help construct more effective and efficient indexing structures.  
We propose C-tree to get this work done, where C means Concept and Classification. C-tree inherits the basic ideas of classic R-tree and classic R-tree's variants (Guttman, 1984). Moreover, the hierarchy semantics encoded in bit strings is extremely useful for resource insertion and query. the hierarchy semantics encoded in bit strings has not on-ly spatial-close but also semantic-close resources stored in adjoining stor-age space.
