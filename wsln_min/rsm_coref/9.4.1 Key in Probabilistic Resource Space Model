As a coordinate system, the Resource Space Model supports accurate re-source location by giving coordinates. However, it is sometimes unneces-sary and even arduous to specify all the coordinates to identify a point, especially for high-dimensional resource spaces. The key of the Resource Space Model is to efficiently locate resources. 
Definition 9.5 Let CK be a subset of axis set {X1, X2, …, Xn}, p1 and p2 be any two non-null points of resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn). CK is called a candidate key of resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) if p1.Xi=p2.Xi, Xi{X1, X2, …, Xn} is implied by p1.Xi=p2.Xi, XiCK. 
Note that there are two concepts in above definition: null point and non-null point. For a given point p, if there exists at least one resource belonging to a given point p, then a given point p is a non-null point, otherwise is a null point. In the Probabilistic Resource Space Model, each resource has a membership probability distribution on all of the points. two concepts in above definition: null point and non-null point make no sense any more. The key in the probabilistic re-source space is defined as follows: 
Definition 9.6. Let CK be a subset of axis set {X1, X2, …, Xn}and p1, p2 be any two points of resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) such that p1.Xi=p2.Xi, XiCK. CK is called a candidate key of resource space RS if CK satisfies: if there exists an axis Xj such that axis set {X1, X2, …, Xn}and and p1.Xjp2.Xj, then Prob(r1R(p1)  r2R(p2))=0 holds for any two resources r1 and r2. 
   The above definition implies a kind of resource dependency: if the event r1 belonging to p1 occurs, the probability of r2 belonging to r2 is 0, i.e. Prob(r2R(p2) | r1R(p1)) = 0. 
Most previous probabilistic relational data models manage entities one by one and seldom concern the relationship between entities. Most previous probabilistic relational data models usual-ly assume that the uncertainty of one entity is independent of another entity. The Probabilistic Resource Space Model should consider some de-pendency between resources. Theorem 9.4 presents a situation where the probabilistic events of two resources should not be supposed to be inde-pendent of each other. 
Theorem 9.4. Let CK be a candidate key of 3NF resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) and CK’ be a subset of 3NF resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) such that CKCK’.  Let p1 and p2 be two points in 3NF resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) such that p1.Xi=p2.Xi (XiCK) and p1.Xjp2.Xj (XjCK’CK). For any two resources r1 and r2, the events r1  and r2  are not independent of each other, and Prob(r1     r2 ) = 0. 
Proof. Suppose that both Prob(r1 )  0  and Prob(r2 )  0 hold. Since RS satisfies 3NF, both  =   and  =   hold. If Prob(r1     r2 )  0, then there must exist at least two points p3 and p4 such that p1.Xi=p3.Xi (XiCK’), p2.Xi=p4.Xi (XiCK’) and Prob(r1R(p3)  r2R(p4))  0 hold. This contradicts to the fact that CK is a candidate key of RS. So Prob(r1     r2 ) = 0 holds. 
