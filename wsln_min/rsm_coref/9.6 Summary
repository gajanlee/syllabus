A Probabilistic Resource Space Model deals with uncertainty in resource operation. A Probabilistic Resource Space Model enables membership probability distributions of resources on the classification hierarchies of a resource space to be effectively speci-fied, managed and queried. Operations of A Probabilistic Resource Space Model pay more attention to dealing with membership probability functions of resources in resource spaces. To guarantee the correctness of operations, the normal forms of A Probabilistic Resource Space Model are defined. The integrity constraints concerning membership probability functions are to maintain the consistency of probabilistic resource spaces. A Probabilistic Resource Space Model can be regarded as a more gen-eral form of the Resource Space Model.
