Here we discuss how the structured P2P RSM deals with node join which allows the structured P2P RSM to grow incrementally. As described above, the entire resource space is partitioned amongst the nodes current-ly in the structured P2P RSM. Thus when a new node joins the structured P2P RSM, one new zone of the coordinate space must be allocated for a new node. Also, a new node needs to initiates a new node's node state, and then informs other nodes of a new node's presence.  
The strategy for new zone allocation is that an existing node splits an existing node's zone into two parts, retains one part and gives the other part to the new node.  
In order to join the structured P2P RSM system, the new node must first find a node, called introducer, currently in the structured P2P RSM system and a node, called introducer, currently in the system's IP address. Many techniques can help to find a node, called introducer, currently in the system. One example of such techniques is introduced in (Eugene and Zhang, 2001). One example of such techniques assumes that the structured P2P RSM system has an associated DNS domain name, and that an associated DNS domain name can resolve to the IP address of one or more bootstrap nodes. A bootstrap node maintains a partial list of structured P2P RSM nodes A bootstrap node believes are currently in the structured P2P RSM system. To join a structured P2P RSM, a new node looks up the domain name in DNS to retrieve a bootstrap node’s IP address. a bootstrap node’s then supplies the IP addresses of several randomly chosen nodes currently in the structured P2P RSM system. 
Then, the new node must select a coordinate D that is suitable for the new node so as to allow the system to allocate one zone for the new node. One method is that the coordinate D is randomly selected in the resource space. The advantage of One method is that the resource space can be divided evenly amongst the nodes currently in the structured P2P RSM system. If the resource indices are also distributed evenly in the resource space, then One method can achieve the load balance simply and naturally. However, this assumption is not tenable in the real resource space. And, selected may lead to an imbalance in the distribution of resource indices across the nodes.  
To cope with this uneven distribution of resource indices, a content-aware coordinate D selection method is proposed to force the distribution of nodes to follow the distribution of resources indices. When a node joins, the coordinate D is selected as the center of the coordinates of resources which will be published by a node. Apparently, if the coordinate D is selected in this way, more nodes will be located in the area where more resource indices exist. Thus, a more balanced index distribution across nodes is achieved. Moreover, a content-aware coordinate D selection method makes the structured P2P RSM have the locality property. As the nodes occupy the zones covering the indices of the nodes's resources, some redirections from indices nodes to resource nodes are saved. And, assuming the resources published by a node can reflect a node's interests, most of the queries initiated by a node would be answered within a small range of neighbors in the structured P2P RSM. 
Fig. 7.4 evaluates this load balancing technique by distributing 5×104 papers onto 1000 nodes using the structured P2P RSM. The X-axis gives the number of indices per node, while the Y-axis gives the percentage of nodes containing the cooresponding number of indices. The CAN series evaluates the original CAN solution. The CAN series serves as the baseline for comparison. The structured P2P RSM-random series uses the random selection of coordinate D. The structured P2P RSM-Content series uses the content-aware coordinate D selection. Note that the load for The structured P2P RSM-random series is poor as the number of indices per node varies largely across nodes. Using content-aware coordinate D selection, most nodes contain less than 70 indices, which is close to the average number 50. The load becomes more balanced as expected. 
After the coordinate D is selected, the new node sends a join request destined for the coordinate D. This message is sent into the structured P2P RSM system via the introducer described above. Each structured P2P RSM node then uses the structured P2P RSM routing mechanism to forward This message until This message reaches the node whose zone contains D. the node whose zone contains D. This current occupant node then splits the node whose zone contains D. This current occupant node's zone into two parts and assigns one part to the new node. The resource indices located in one part are also transfered to the new node.
