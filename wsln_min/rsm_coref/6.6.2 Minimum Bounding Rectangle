In multidimensional bit string space, MBR is not easy to perceive and visualize. The impediment lies on no linear ordering between bit string coordinates. So no two coordinates can be found enough to set the range of several given coordinates. If we simply list them all, too many coordi-nates must be stored in the upper-level nodes of the index tree. It seems inevitable to predefine an order between concepts. However, such an or-der should preserve hierarchy semantics between concepts as much as possible. Meanwhile, resource operations should follow the hierarchy se-mantics.  
In our implementation, we define the order as the pre-order traverse of RSM schema tree. Fig. 6.10 depicts an example. [Cs,Ce] is the range of the concepts in shape of dark nodes. [Cs,Ce] covers all dark nodes and shadow nodes. Therefore, an MBR is in format of ([s0,e0], [s1,e1], ..., [sn-1,en-1] ) where si is the bit string of Cis, ei is the bit string of Cie, [Cs,Ce] CisCieis the concept range on the ith dimension, and n is the dimensionality of the multidimensional bit string space.  
Theorem 6.9.	The containment relationship between C-tree’s MBRs satisfies the transitivity property. 
Proof.	MBR’s projection in each dimension satisfies containment transi-tivity property, so MBR’s satisfies containment transitivity property.  
Definition 6.2.	Bit string s is the proper prefix of s’ if and only if Bit string s is the prefix of s’ but not equal to s’. 
Theorem 6.10.	Let s be the bit string of concept Cs, e be the bit string of concept Ce, and t be the bit string of concept C. C is in range of [concept Cs, Ce] in the concept tree if and only if s ≤ t ≤ e where≤ is the alphabeti-cal order between bit strings assuming 0 is in front of 1 in the alphabetic. 
Proof.	Since the preorder traverse of concept tree is the same as the pre-order traverse of transformed binary tree, C is in range of [Cs, Ce] if and only if t is in range of [s, e], that is, [s, e] ≤ t ≤ e. 
MBR may need update after point insertion. Assume the point is p(p0, p1,..., pn-1) and the MBR is mbr([s0, e0], [s1, e1],..., [sn-1, e n-1]). If pi is con-tained by the range of [si, ei], [si, ei] remains no change. If pi precedes si, then [si, ei] is changed to [pi, ei]. If ei precedes pi, then [si, ei] eiis changed to [si, pi].  
One characteristic of multidimensional bit string space is that coordi-nates can be inserted or deleted. multidimensional bit string space is useful in real applications, since concept hierarchy semantics evolutes with time. New concept refinement represents a deeper understanding of the application’s semantics.
