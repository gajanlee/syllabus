Insert policy decides which MBR among several sibling MBRs is the best to incorporate the given point. In conventional multidimensional space, good means least area enlargement, least overlap area enlargement, least perimeter, etc. The basic idea is making MBR more compact so that blank space is as small as possible. In this way, less space needs accessed in the query process.  
In multidimensional bit string space, however, such three good meas-urements are hard to compute since we do not know exactly how many coordinates are inside a given concept range. What we are able to know is the following two:  
1.	whether the containment relationship satisfies between concept and concept range, and  
2.	the semantic distance between concept and the start/end concepts of the concept range.  
We will show how to define the semantic distance between a concept and a concept range, which contributes to more compact MBRs as well as better grouping according to semantic clustering.  
Definition 6.3.	Given a point p(p0, p1,..., pn-1) and an MBR mbr([s0, e0], [s1, e1],..., [sn-1, en-1]), the semantic distance between a point p(p0, p1,..., pn-1) and mbr is meas-ured by distPM(p, mbr) = i=0..n-1 min{dist(pi, si), dist(pi, ei)}.  
The smaller is distPM, the better is the insertion of p into mbr. Two cases needs to be taken into account when deciding the best sibling MBR to insert p into. 
When p is inside one or more MBRs, resolve tie by selecting the MBR which has the smallest semantic distance to p according to Definition 6.3. This aims at promoting the compactness of MBR.  
When p is outside each MBR, three measurements are considered in decreasing priority. 
1.	least overlap. Let overlapNum(mbr, i) be the number of sibling MBRs whose projections on ith dimension intersect with MBR mbr’s projection on ith dimension.  Let mbr’ be the MBR after inserting point p into MBR mbr’s. Then overlapNum(mbr’, i)-overlapNum(mbr, i) measures the increased projection overlap number on ith dimension for inserting point p into MBR mbr’s. least overlap is the MBR with the smallest i=0..n-1 (overlapNum(mbr’, i)-overlapNum(mbr, i) ). 
2.	least semantic distance. Select the MBR which has the smallest semantic distance to p as defined in Definition 6.3. 
3.	least perimeter enlargement. Suppose mbr’ ([s0’, e0’], [s1’, e1’],..., [sn-1’, en-1’]) is the resulting MBR of inserting point p(p0, p1,..., pn-1) into MBR mbr ([e0, e0], [s1, e1],..., [sn-1, en-1]). The perimeter enlargement is i=0..n-1 ([si’, ei’][si, ei] ), where [si’, ei’]  [si, ei] is equal to dist (si’, si)+dist (ei’, ei).
