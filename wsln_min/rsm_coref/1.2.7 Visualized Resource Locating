Locating resources is the basic operation of the Resource Space Model. Users can accurately locate a set of resources by giving coordinates on every axis. The underlying premise is that users know the structure of the space or that usersâ€™ viewpoint consists with the space designers on classi-fication of resources.  A visualized resource locator provides users with intuitive knowledge on the structure of the spacethe space. 
Fig.1.5 shows a three-dimensional visualized resource locator for ex-hibiting Dunhuang culture. Points in the space correspond to the small cubes in the 3-dimensional large cube.  Each side of the 3-dimensional large cube can display image, text and links.  Users can see the details by clicking the details.  The operations are arranged as buttons in the up-row. 
Fig.1.6. shows an n-dimensional visualized resource locator.  Users can create a view by selecting axes from the n-dimensional resource space.
