In the classical Resource Space Model, before a resource r can be inserted into a resource space RS, we have to identify the coordinates which a resource r be-longs to on each axis in a resource space RS. 
Take Fig. 9.5 as an example. The resource space RS(Classes, Courses) is used to manage students according to students's classes and selected cours-es. Once the resource r has been identified that the resource r belongs to coordinate Database on axis Courses and to coordinate C2 on axis Classes, the resource r can be inserted into the point (Database, C2). 
From the perspective of probability, r(Courses=Database, Classes=C2) implies the fact that the membership probability functions of resource r on axes Courses and Classes are r-Courses and r-Classes respectively such that r-Courses(Math)=0, r-Courses(Operating System)=0 and r-Courses(Database)=1 as well as r-Classes(C1)=0, r- Classes(C2)=1 and r- Clas-ses(C3)=0.  
The process of inserting a resource into a probabilistic resource space is the same as the classical resource space except that the membership probability functions in the Probabilistic Resource Space Model can take value within the range [0, 1]. 
The following is the insertion statement used to insert a resource r in-to a resource space RS. 1, 2, …, n are the membership probability functions of a resource r on axes X1, X2, …, Xn respectively. INSERT r<1, 2, …, n> INTO a resource space RSX1Xn> 
The probabilistic Resource Space Model also supports the following delete operation and update operation: DELETE r FROM RS [WHERE <conditional expression>] UPDATE r<bi,…, bj> INTO RS<Xi,…, Xj> [WHERE <conditional expression>]
