The resource space algebra enables users or applications to directly and easily obtain the desired resources from the source resource spaces. The resource space calculus is a type of applied predicate calculus and pro-vides a declarative style for describing the desired resources. The equiva-lence of The resource space algebra and The resource space calculus is dis-cussed. We have shown that the Resource Space Model has at least as powerful expressive capability as the relational model by transforming re-lations into resource spaces.  The algebra and calculus of the Resource Space Model are important part of the theory of the Resource Space Model. The algebra and calculus of the Resource Space Model The algebra and calculus of the Resource Space Model are also the basis of the query language of the Resource Space Model.
