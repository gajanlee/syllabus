Fig.2.6 describes the cooperation between the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network for a simple teaching system. A node in this graph represents a resource or a set of resources. The dotted circles repre-sent resource class hierarchies, each of which corresponds to a resource space. The rectangles in dotted circles denote the resource classes corre-sponding to a class of resources in the Resource Space Model. Both the circle and the triangle represent generic classes defined in the Semantic Link Network. And the rounded rectangles denote the printable classes, the system-defined classes similar to the basic types in program-ming languages (Hull and King, 1987; Ullman, 1988). Using the printable classes, the system-defined classes similar to the basic types in program-ming languages, the atomic value of attributes can be precisely represented. The only String class has three duplications for clarity. The edges and edge labels in this graph are used to represent the relationships between nodes. Note that the edges without labels in The dotted circles represent the inclusion relationships between resource classes. 
Fig.2.6 has two resource class hierarchies: Human-Resource and Score-Course derived from the corresponding resource spaces Human-Resource and Score-Course in the RSM. Human-Resource is used to store the information about all teachers and students. And Score-Course is used to manage the information about the test scores of the students. 
Definition 2.6. The Union View of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network is a triple S = (VE, RE, RCH), where VE is a fi-nite set of nodes in the Union View which could include resources, ge-neric classes, printable classes and resource classes derived from the Resource Space Model; RE is a finite set of triple <v1, v2, re>, where RE rep-resents the relationship between nodes v1 and v2 coming from VE; and, RCH is a finite set of resource class hierarchies each of which corre-sponds to a resource space in the meaning of the Resource Space Model. 
The Union View has the following three advantages: 
(1) The Union View provides an efficient mapping mechanism from Re-source Space Model to Semantic Link Network. Semantic Link Network is a general-purpose semantic-rich model for the representation of resources and can provide a semantic overlay for many data models in the style of map. Since each resource class hierarchy corresponds to a re-source space, by introducing the resource class hierarchies into Semantic Link Network, The Union View provides an efficient and ef-fective mapping from Re-source Space Model to Semantic Link Network. The efficiency and effectiveness of an efficient and ef-fective mapping from the Resource Space Model to the Semantic Link Network depend on the following two points:  
a)	The Union View of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network increases the granularity of the mapping from Resource Space Model to Semantic Link Network. In the original Semantic Link Network, each resource defined in Resource Space Model has a mapping image in Semantic Link Network. However in The Union View of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network, a point, an axis and even a resource space in Resource Space Model can be mapped to a node in Semantic Link Network. Thus, many operations can be applied to a batch of resources.  
b)	The Union View of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network provides not only resource mappings but also operation mappings from Resource Space Model to Semantic Link Network. 
(2) The Union View of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network makes use of Resource Space Model to make the Semantic Link Net-work modeling easier. Many traditional methods such as entity-relation model can be used to help modeling with Semantic Link Network (Chen, 1976). Since quick and easy modeling is one of the salient fea-tures of Resource Space Model, the resource class hierarchies in The Union View of Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network make the Semantic Link Net-work modeling easier without conflicting with other approaches. 
(3) The Union View of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network can enhance the interoperability between Semantic Link Networks.  Semantic Link Network operations are mainly based on the structure in-formation. The Union View of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network has introduced some new RSM-based opera-tions, which emphasize on not only the structure but also the semantics of Semantic Link Networks. Thus, The Union View of the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network the Resource Space Model the Semantic Link Network can enhance the interoperability be-tween Semantic Link Networks.
