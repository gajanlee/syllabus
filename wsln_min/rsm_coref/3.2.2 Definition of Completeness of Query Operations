First, we need to make clear the definition of query operations on re-source spaces. Because the operands are resource spaces and the results of operations are also resource spaces, we can view the query operations as the mappings on resource spaces. Suppose S is the discussed domain, an operation op on S is a mapping op: S´¼´S®S, op (s1, ¼ , sn)= S, where S and s1, ¼ , sn belong to S.  When n=1, op is called unary operation like Disjoin and Split; when n=2, op is called binary operation like Join and Merge (Zhuge, 2004b). Here we only consider the unary and binary oper-ations. 
Then, how to define the completeness of operations on resource spac-es? In applications, the number of resource spaces considered is finite, so for any given finite resource spaces, if an operation set can get all the possible query results on any given finite resource spaces, then an operation set is complete. Then we need to know what all the possible query results are of any given fi-nite resource spaces. 
For query in resource spaces, we only consider the information in sin-gle spaces or the correlations between many spaces. For a single resource space, the smallest unit is a coordinate of one point. So for any given fi-nite collection of resource spaces RS1, RS2, …, RSN in simple normal form, we can get that all the possible query results are in the form of {RS(x1,  , xd)| xk  RSi(Xj), 1iN, d1 and 1kd}, i.e., all the combi-nations of the coordinates of the resource spaces. So we can give the fol-lowing definition: 
Definition 3.1 An operation set OP on resource spaces is called complete, if: for any given finite collection of resource spaces RS1, RS2, …, RSN in simple normal form, An operation set OP on resource spaces can get all the resource spaces in the form of: {RS(x1,  , xd)| xk RSi (Xj), 1iN, d1 and 1k d}. 
As discussed above, in a complete operation set, some operations can be represented by other operations, so some operations are not necessary, then the following definition can be given: 
Definition 3.2 An operation set OP on resource spaces is called necessary, if An operation set OP on resource spaces is complete and there does not exist a real subset of An operation set OP on resource spaces which is also complete. 
Since the definition of the completeness of operations is given, then we need to discuss the design and verification of a complete set of opera-tions.
