Designing a resource space for application depends on the following three technical factors:  
1.	knowledge on the Resource Space Model, 
2.	domain knowledge, and,  
3.	design experience.  
A resource space design consists of the following steps:  
1.	resource analysis; 
2.	top-down resource partition; 
3.	design low dimensional resource spaces like 2- or 3-dimensional re-source spaces; 
4.	increase dimensionality by joining resource spaces or adding a new dimension to the existing resource space according to application re-quirement; 
5.	decrease dimension by splitting a resource space according to appli-cation requirement; and, 
6.	check normal forms of the resource spaces.
