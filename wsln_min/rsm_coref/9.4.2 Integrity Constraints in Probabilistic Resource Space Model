Modification of resources may result in inconsistency in resource spaces. Entity integrity constraint, membership integrity constraint, reference in-tegrity constraint and user-defined integrity constraint have been pro-posed in the classical Resource Space Model. More integrity constraint rules are needed in the probabilistic Resource Space Model. 
Rule 1 For resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), let ri be the membership probabilistic function of resource r at axis Xi, (1in). For any coordinate C at axis Xi, 0 ri(C) 1 must hold. If any two coordinates at axis Xi are independ-ent of each other, then  1 holds. 
  Since ri(C) represents the probability of resource r belonging to coordi-nate C, it is natural to require 0ri(C)1. For axis Xi, R(Xi) =  holds. If any two coordinates at axis Xi are independent of each other, Prob(rR(Xi)) =  . So   1 must hold. The inser-tion and modification of resources and merge operations between re-source spaces may violate 1. 
Rule 2 For resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xn) and resource r, let ri and rj be the membership probabilistic functions of resource r at Xi and Xj (1i, jn) respectively. If Xi can be finely classified by Xj (1i, jn) and any two coordi-nates at Xi are independent of each other, then    must hold. If Xi is orthogonal with Xj (1i, jn), i.e. XiXj holds, then  =  must hold. 
   The above rule holds because of the following two points: 
1.	Prob(rR(Xi))  Prob(rR(Xj)) is implied by R(Xi)R(Xj), which is implied by Xi/Xj. And both Prob(rR(Xi))=  and Prob(rR(Xj)) =  hold since R(Xi) =  and R(Xj) = . Thus   . 
2.	If Xi  Xj, both Xi/Xj and Xj/Xi hold, then both     and     hold. So   =  holds. 
Rule 3 For any 3NF resource space RS and resource r, let ri be the mem-bership probabilistic function of resource r at Xi of any 3NF resource space RS. For any coordinate C at Xi and point p in any 3NF resource space RS,  = ri(C) must hold. 
  According to theorem 9.3, in any 3NF resource space, the probability of r belonging to coordinate C can be partitioned into all the points having projection C at axis Xi, i.e. Prob(rR(C)) =  holds. Rule 3 should be checked to make sure the maintenance of theorem 9.3 when inserting or updating resources. 
Rule 4 Let RS1, RS2 and RS be three resource spaces such that RS1RS2RS. 
1.	For any resource r in RS and any non-common axis Xi in RS, let ri and ri’ be the membership probabilistic functions of RS at any non-common axis Xi in RS1 in resource spaces RS and RS respectively. If there does not exist any common axis Xj of RS and RS2 such that XjXi holds, then for any coordinate C at any non-common axis Xi in RS1, ri(C) = ri’(C) must hold; 
2.	For any resource r in RS and any non-common axis Xi in RS2, let ri and ri’ be the membership probabilistic functions of RS at any non-common axis Xi in RS2 in resource spaces RS and RS2 respectively. If there does not exist any common axis Xj of RS and RS2 such that XjXi holds, then for any coordinate C at any non-common axis Xi in RS2, ri(C) = ri’(C) must hold; 
3.	For any resource r in RS and any common axis Xt of RS and RS2, let rt, rt’ and rt” be the membership probabilistic functions of r at Xt in resource spaces RS, RS and RS2 respectively. For any co-ordinate C at Xt, min{rt’(C), rt”(C)}  rt(C)  max{rt’(C), rt”(C)} must hold. 
   Resource space RS results from the join operation on RS1 and RS2, and rule 4 maintains the dependency of RS on RS1 and RS2RS2. Thus, rule 4 should be checked when insertion, deletion and modification opera-tions are executed. 
Rule 5 Let RS1(X1, …, Xn-1, X'), RS2(X1, …, Xn-1, X”) and RS(X1, …, Xn-1, X*) be three resource spaces such that RS1RS2RS and X*=X'X”. 
1.	For any resource r, let r, r’ and r” be the membership probabil-istic functions of r at X*, X' and X” in resource spaces RS, RS1 and RS2 respectively. For any coordinate C at X*, if any coordinate C at X* is at both RS1 and RS2, min{r’(C), r”(C)}  r(C)  max{r’(C), r”(C)} must hold; otherwise, r(C) = r’(C) must hold if any coordinate C at X* is at RS1, or r(C) = r”(C) must hold if any coordinate C at X* is at RS2; and,  
2.	For any axis Xi (1in1) and resource r, let ri, ri’ and ri” be the membership probabilistic functions of resource r at any axis Xi (1in1) in resource spaces RS, RS1 and RS2 respectively. For any coordinate C at any axis Xi (1in1), min{ri’(C), ri”(C)}  ri(C)  max{ri’(C), ri”(C)} must hold. 
  As the result of merge operation on RS1 and RS2, RS should satisfy rule 5.  Thus, rule 5 should be checked when insertion, deletion and modification operations are executed.
