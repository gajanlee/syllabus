The resource space calculus consists of several classes of objects. several classes of objects include variables, terms, formulas and alpha expressions. 
The set V of variables is the countable sets {p, p1, p2, p3 ...}, where each pi stands for a point variable. A point variable p is a free variable if A point variable p does not occur within the scope of any quantifier ( or ). Otherwise A point variable p is a bound variable. 
The set T of terms is composed of the following six parts.  
1.	Any noun or noun phrase in ontology qualified to name coordinates is in T.  
2.	Any axis of a certain resource space, the split of an axis or the merge of two axes belong to T.  
3.	For any point variable pi and any point variable pi's any axis Xj, pi[Xj] is a term.  
4.	For every point variable pi, the set R(pi[Xj]) is a term.  
5.	For every point variable pi, fc(pi[Xj]) is a term.  
6.	Integers not less than 0 belong to T. 
The set RF of range formulas is defined as follows.  
1.	Let RSi be a resource space and point variable pV, then RSi(p) be-longs to RF (The monadic predicate RSi(p) is used to state that point variable pV has the range of RSi.)  
2.	If point variable p is the only point variable in a range formula, then a range formula is called a range formula over p. Let ,  be two range formulas over p. Then  belongs to RF.  
3.	Let , RF. For any point variable p in and , if all resource spaces specifying the range of any point variable p in and in and  are union-compatible, then both the disjunction  and the conjunction  are in RF. 
The set F of formulas includes the following six types of formulas.  
1.	Any range formula in RF is in F.  
2.	Coordinate formula has one of the two forms (a) pm[Xi]  Y, where Y may be pn[Xj] or just a noun and noun phrase in T and  represents any of the relations =, , <, ,  and >; (b) pm[Xi]  Y, where Y is a set of nouns and noun phrases in T and  represents  or .  
3.	Let  be any of the relations =, , , , ,  and . Set formula has the form of R(pm[Xi]) R(pn[Xj]).  
4.	Let  be any of the relations =, , <, ,  and >. Cardinality formula has the form of fc(pi)  Y, where Y may be fc(pj) or just an integer not less than 0.  
5.	If ,   F, then the negation , the disjunction  and the con-junction  are in F. And,  
6.	Let  be a range formula over p. Then the quantification () and () are in F. 
It is obvious that each qualifier ( or ) in F must be associated with a range formula over a point variable. The expanded forms of () and () are as follows. 
() = p(  ) 
() = p(  ) 
As with the relational calculus, the range of each point variable in a formula should be definitely specified (Codd, 1972). For any formula  in F,  is a well-formed formula (WFF in simple) over p if  has the form of U1  Un  V, where 
1.	U1 through Un are range formulas over n point variables varying from one another; 
2.	V belongs to F and satisfies: 
a)	The range of every free variable except p in V has been speci-fied by a certain Ui; 
b)	No rang formula occurs in V. 
Then this WFF over p is denoted as (p). 
	Let (p) be a WFF formula over (p) and Xi (1in) be a group of axes. The alpha expression can be defined as follows: 
1.	p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): (p) is an alpha expression; 
2.	If both p(X1, X2, ..., Xn):  and p(X1, X2, ..., Xn):  are alpha expres-sions, then the following are alpha expressions. 
a)	p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): 
b)	p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): 
c)	p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): 
	p(X1, X2, ..., Xn) is called the target point and the logical expression fol-lowing the colon is called the qualification. The semantics of the alpha expression p(X1, X2, ..., Xn): (p) is to construct a resource space RS con-sisting of axes X1, X2, ..., and Xn where for any point p if any point p satisfies (p) then any point p is non-null, otherwise any point p is null. 
	The set AE is defined as the set of all alpha expressions, each of which can be used to represent a query in a certain resource space system.
