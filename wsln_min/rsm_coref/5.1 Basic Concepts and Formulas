When a user gives a query Q(X1=q1, , Xn=qn), what is the complexity of searching the point Q(X1=q1, , Xn=qn) in resource space RS(X1, , Xn)? The basic approach is to check the axis and coordinate for qi (i=1, …, n) one by one. Here focuses on the intrinsic complexity of searching in re-source space based on comparison between names rather than any specif-ic searching algorithms.
