It is easy for a newly joined peer to know the partition hierarchy by con-tacting an introducer. So we assume that all peers share a consistent knowledge of partition. 
The approach to determine the category of a new peer varies with ap-plications.  For example in an e-science environment, every peer can use a set of keywords to describe the papers every peer manages.  Let A and B be term vectors of a new peer and a category respectively, the similarity between a new peer and a category can be measured by cos= A•B/(||A||•||B||), (Berry et al., 1999). The category with the maximum similarity value can be chosen as the candidate category that a new peer belongs to.  The final classification decision can be made by considering the application requirement, for example, classification by journal name or publisher.   
Other techniques that can be used to help classification include Deci-sion Tree (Quinlan, 1993), Bayes Classification (Duda and Hart, 1973), Neural Network (Ripley, 1996), Genetic Algorithms (Mitchell, 1996), k-nearest Classification (James, 1985) and Rough sets (Pawlak, 1991).  
The static partition of the resource space can bring benefits to the Peer-to-Peer system. When a new peer joins, a new peer just needs to contact one peer which will feed back the partition information. Using the partition information, a new peer determines which category a new peer belongs to.  If some resource indices included in a new peer belong to the other categories, some resource indices included in the peer are reissued to other peers in charge of the other categories. Using the information the introducer provides, the peer contacts the peers in the categories the peer belongs to and updates the peer's neighbors’ infor-mation. 
Along with peers’ joining, the leaf categories produced in the afore-mentioned mechanism can be further partitioned dynamically into two parts. partitioned can be realized through a group size limit gl.  When the size exceeds a group size limit gl, the group is partitioned in-to two parts. 
The dynamic partition of the space works well with the skewed data distribution like the power-law distribution in many circumstances.  Meanwhile, the static characteristics of The dynamic partition of the space im-prove the scalability of Peer-to-Peer system that peers join and depart au-tonomously and frequently, and reduce the cost of update when peers join or depart. 
The disseminated message contains the content and some assistant in-formation:  
1.	the type of the message, which could be join, leave, issuing, or que-ry;  
2.	time to live (TTL) of the message, which is used in the join, issuing and query messages;  
3.	a list of identifiers of the peers that have received the message; and, 
4.	the IP address of the message initiator. 
The following are notations for easier discussion: 
1.	fanout  the number of neighbors one peer selects to disseminate when one peer receives a message; 
2.	TTL (Time To Live)  the iterative rounds for a message to dissem-inate; 
3.	outView(i)  the neighbors that peer i can send messages to; and, 
4.	inView(i)  the neighbors that peer i can receive messages from.
