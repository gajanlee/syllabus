The first normal form of the Resource Space Model is used to eliminate the redundancy caused by name duplication between coordinates. The first normal form of the Resource Space Model also applies to the probabilistic Resource Space Model. The second normal form of the Resource Space Model is to eliminate the redundancy caused by coordinate dependency. Any second normal form resource space is al-so a first normal form resource space.  
Definition 9.2. A probabilistic resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) is a 2NF resource space if for any resource r and any two coordinates C and C’ on Xi (1in), Prob(rR(C)  rR(C’))=0 holds. 
Above definition is actually an explanation of the 2NF of Resource Space Model from probability point of view. 
Theorem 9.1. For axis X, if any two coordinates on axis X are independent of each other, then for any resource r, Prob(rR(X)) =  1 holds. 
Proof. For axis X = {C1, C2, …, Cm}, R(X) = R(C1)R(C2)…R(Cm) holds. Because any two coordinates Ci and Cj (1ijm) on axis X = {C1, C2, …, Cm} are inde-pendent of each other, Prob(rR(Ci)  rR(Cj))=0 holds. So the probabil-ity of resource r belonging to R(Ci)R(Cj) is the sum of the probability of resource r belonging to R(Ci) and the probability of resource r belonging to R(Cj), i.e. Prob(rR(Ci)  rR(Cj)) = Prob(rR(Ci)) + Prob(rR(Cj)). So the proba-bility of resource r belonging to axis X = {C1, C2, …, Cm} is the sum of the probability of resource r belonging to each coordinate on axis X = {C1, C2, …, Cm}, i.e. Prob(rR(X)) =  holds. 
In theorem 9.1,  < 1 means that there is a probabil-ity of r not belonging to axis X. For a resource space RS satisfying 2NF, the probability of r belonging to any axis can be evaluated from the membership probability function of r on any axis.
