Designers can easily handle low-dimensional spaces.  So we can first de-sign low dimensional resource spaces then add a new dimension to the existing space or integrate low-dimensional spaces into higher dimen-sional resource spaces.  
A multi-layer table like Table 1.1 is suggested to help design a 2-dimensional resource space. 
The design process is as follows: 
1.	Determine the number of resource spaces according to the number of top-level resource categories in the domain.  For example, three resource spaces can be established for human resources, inheritance resources and faciliate resources. 
2.	Determine axes’ names according to the resource categories at the universal level or domain level.  An axis name represents a category of the domain-level partition. 
3.	Determine the first-level coordinate names.  Each coordinate reflects one of the categories of the axis. 
4.	Determine the coordinate hierarchies.  For each first-level coordinate, determine each first-level coordinate's low-level coordinates top-down until the basic category according to the resource partition hierarchy.  The granularity of the basic category depends on the application requirement on resource retrieval. 
5.	Check independency between coordinates.  If independency between coordinates is not satisfied, re-consider resource-partition at this level and adjust coordinates. 
6.	Check orthogonality between axes. If orthogonality between axes is not satisfied, re-consider the coordinate settings, and then adjust relevant coordinates. 
According to the above process, designers can construct two resource spaces as shown in Fig.1.16 for the resource partition example of Fig.1.15. 
The Resource Space Model allows existing spaces to be joined into one to achieve the effect of the global resource view. Whether we need to join multiple resource spaces into one depends on application requirement. 
To implement the join operation, we need to check the condition of the join operation first.  It is important to ensure that different spaces to be joined to specify the same type of resources. 
For example, the two resource spaces of Fig.1.16 share a common axis and specify the same type of resources.  So they can be joined into one 3-dimensional resource space as shown in Fig.1.17. 
The join operation may create new spaces, e.g., joining two two-dimensional resource spaces will generate one three-dimensional resource space where there exists a new two-dimensional space.  The points in a new two-dimensional space should be defined together with a new two-dimensional space.   For non-empty resource spaces, the following two strategies can be adopted:  
1.	Place the common resources in the old points sharing common coor-dinates of different spaces into the new points and keep the rest re-sources in the original space (i.e., the subspace of the new space); and,  
2.	Keep old resources in the original spaces (i.e., the subspace of the new space) and establish the mapping between the new points and the original spaces. 
Another example of creating a high dimensional space from two low dimensional spaces is shown in Fig. 1.18.   two low dimensional spaces specifies the same type of resourceshuman; and, two low dimensional spaces share two axesJournal and Responsibility.  So two low dimensional spaces can be joined into a 4-dimensional resource space to finely classify the resources.
