Anything in the world is not isolated, has Anything in the world's existence condition  cer-tain relations with others. That is why children are often trained to learn concepts by filling in blanks with a given context. 
The Semantic Link Network (in short SLN) is a semantic model for de-scribing the appearance, abstraction or implied relations between re-sources.  Although sometimes it seems no clear relations between two re-sources, abstraction semantic relations may be derived out by semantic relation reasoning. 
As shown in Fig. 1.23, a Semantic Link Network usually consists of an abstraction level and an instance level (Zhuge, 2007).  An abstraction Semantic Link Network is the abstraction of several instance Semantic Link Networks. 
The semantic link is the natural extension of the hyperlink.  A seman-tic link connects two semantic nodes with certain semantics.  A semantic node can be an identity, a semantic description and even a Semantic Link Network.  A Semantic Link Network naturally supports semantic reason-ing based on the semantic linking rules. 
A semantic link can be reinterpreted to suit particular applications.  For example, reference relation can be explained as the citation relation be-tween papers, explained as the call relation between programs, and can be also explained as the foreign key relation between relational tables.   
Application-specific semantic links need to be defined to support do-main applications.  For example, the layout relation is useful in specify-ing the relations between wall-paintings.   Browsers for Semantic Link Network can be developed according to application requirements (Zhuge et al., 2004e). 
Fig.1.24 shows the interface of a semantic relation search mechanism for exhibiting Dunhuang culture.  Users can see the interested resources, the relevant resources and the relations between the interested resources, the relevant resources. 
Semantic link was initiated for describing the relations between mod-els for improving model retrieval (Zhuge, 1998). Semantic link was then extended to construct Active Document Framework (ADF) as a new e-document model (Zhuge, 2003). Semantic link was systematically introduced in The Knowledge Grid (Zhuge, 2004d), where a single semantic image integrates Resource Space Model and Semantic Link Network, and a unified single semantic image query language was suggested.   
The Semantic Link Network has been proved useful in Web page pre-fetching and object pre-fetching (Pons, 2005; Pons, 2006).  As a seman-tic model, The Semantic Link Network concerns typical semantic relations and relation reasoning. Developers need to design application-specific re-lations to support applications. 
A Semantic Link represents the semantic relation of a property or a set of properties between two semantic nodes. A semantic link can be of the following types: cause-effect (ce), implication (imp), subtype (st), similar-to (sim), instance (ins), sequential (seq) and reference (ref).  
The Semantic Link Network naturally supports a semantic peer-to-peer network to improve the efficiency of peer-to-peer query routing (Zhuge and Li, 2007b).  How to automatically establish the semantic links is a major challenge. 
The Resource Space Model focuses on the classification on the content of resources, while the Semantic Link Network focuses on the external semantics of resources.  It is not realistic to expect the Semantic Link Network to be able to describe complicated semantics that requires expert knowledge in such areas as natural language processing, logics and math-ematics. 
A Semantic Link Network can be established autonomously by incor-porating logical reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and assistant tools.  A large-scale Semantic Link Network can be formed by integrating individual Semantic Link Networks.  Semantic Link Net-works keep evolving with the execution of the up-level applications and human behaviors of using the network. 
To reflect the probable relations, the Semantic Link Network can be extended to a probabilistic Semantic Link Network:  One node can link to any other semantically relevant node with a probability.   The uncertain semantic link can be represented as A<,p>B, where  is a semantic factor and p is the probability of . 
Metcalfe’s Law states that "The power of the network increases expo-nentially by the number of computers connected to the network. Therefore, every computer added to the network both uses the network as a resource while adding re-sources in a spiral of increasing value and choice." 
What is the effect of the Semantic Link Network? 
The importance of a Semantic Link Network depends on the number of people defining and maintaining semantic links rather than the definition of semantic links the definition of semantic links itself.   
The evolution of the Semantic Link Network will form a kind of se-mantic effect that helps promote decentralized applications. 
In daily life, people often ask neighbors/friends when people have ques-tions so neighbors/friends are likely to hold relevant contents.  For scien-tific papers, citation relations are dense between papers of the same area. This semantic relevancy leads to a semantic community phenomenon in pursuing efficiency.  
The semantic communities can help promote the efficiency of search-ing relevant concepts by focusing on a specific semantic community. 
Semantic locality requests to store relevant contents in semantically close places. 
The storage mechanism of the Resource Space Model concerns the se-mantic locality to ensure search efficiency.   The storage mechanism of the Resource Space Model is also a criterion to im-plement a P2P semantic overlay to support semantic-rich decentralized applications. 
The Semantic Link Network is a general semantic space. The Semantic Link Network focuses only on one type of relationthe classification rela-tion, so The Semantic Link Network can be regarded as a special case of the Semantic Link Net-work. 
The Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network follow dif-ferent rules. The theories on The Resource Space Model are not suitable for the Semantic Link Network.  However, a resource space can be trans-formed into a Semantic Link Network, and a special Semantic Link Net-work can also be transformed into a resource space. Moreover, The Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network can be integrated to provide views of different layers: The Resource Space Model the Semantic Link Network provides with a classifica-tion view while the Semantic Link Network provides with a scalable se-mantic link network view.
