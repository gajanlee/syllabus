A software tool that can efficiently manage and locate photos is very use-ful.  Usually, we store photos in folders of a file system (the directories of a file system actually constitutes a 1-dimensional resource space).  To ef-ficiently locate resources, we can choose database systems to record in-formation about photos such as place, time, and the path of storing pho-tos. 
However, people concern content of photos rather than photos's names when retrieving. The contents can be classified into three categories: hu-man, artifact and nature.  The contents can also be classified by time and place.  So photos’ content can be specified by a 3-dimensional resource space as shown in Fig. 1.9.   Each coordinate can be a coordinate tree, for exam-ple, coordinate China can be classified into Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an, etc. 
This application proposes a new requirement: adding new coordinates during use, as we cannot estimate future visiting places and photos are added to the resource space after visiting. 
New coordinates can be added to the resource space if the resource space's original nor-mal forms can be retained.  But a Resource Space Model system needs to update a Resource Space Model system's schemas at all levels in this case.
