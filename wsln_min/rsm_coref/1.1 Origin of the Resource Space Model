Files are expanding in our daily-use PCs or laptops due to easier down-load from websites and email attachments. Management of these accu-mulating files is troublesome if we arbitrarily save these accu-mulating files.  For example, saving files in the desktop of Windows seems convenient, but saving will cause inefficient retrieval of files and slow down the speed of machine in the long run.  Appropriately naming folders to contain various files is a way to efficient file management and retrieval. Inappropriately naming will cause trouble in retrieval of files due to synonym or poor meaning. 
Goods in supermarkets are arranged by classification. Goods are placed and updated according to the commonsense of the classification shared between customers and sellers. Chain supermarkets often arrange goods in a uniform style and place good categories in the same order so that customers can quickly reach customers's targets.  the same order is an experience for customers to raise the efficiency in selecting goods by going directly to the interested category or region. We can also find that some closely rele-vant goods are arranged in neighborhood. This neighbor information also helps customers to select goods. These strategies bring efficiency and convenience for sellers to manage goods and for customers to select goods. 
Biologists classify organisms into categories by judging degrees of appar-ent similarity and difference.  On discovering an unknown organism, sci-entists begin sci-entists's classification by looking for anatomical features that have the same function as those found on other species, and then deter-mine whether or not the similarities are due to an independent evolution or to descent from a common ancestor.  If the latter is the case, then the two species could be classified into the same category. 
Children start to learn concepts by classifying real-world objects into categories and by generalizing and specializing categories via instances.  So classification is not only an approach to efficiently managing re-sources but also a basic method for human to know the real world. 
A (Web) Resource Space Model (in simple RSM) is a semantic data mod-el for specifying, storing, managing and locating contents of (Web) re-sources by appropriate classification on the contents of resources.  
The notion of the Web resource space was initiated in 2002 as a multi-dimensional knowledge space (Zhuge, 2002). the Web resource space's basic model was pro-posed in 2004 (Zhuge, 2004a-d). 
A resource space is a multi-dimensional classification space where di-mensions (axes) are discrete so A resource space is different from ordinary distance space. A resource space's intrinsic characteristics are worth studying.  
A resource space can be normalized to ensure the correctness of man-aging resources by setting constraints on axes.  
The Resource Space Model methodology is a study of the basic method for designing resource spaces and helping the development of resource spaces's applica-tions. 
Data model and algorithm are the core of software systems. 
File system is the first milestone towards effective computing resource management.   It is a method for storing, managing and retrieving re-sources in form of files by establishing mapping between a directory in-dexing structure and a storage device.  a directory in-dexing structure can keep track of the files and path syntax required to access the files. a directory in-dexing structure de-fines the way files are named as well as the maximum size of a file or volume. A file system is a component of most operating systems. A file system pro-fessionals have used various indexing techniques to raise the efficiency of managing data in files.   
The file system can be regarded as a 1-dimensional resource space. 
Database is another milestone towards effective resource management. Most databases use file systems as the underlying mapping mechanism between the higher level indexes and the storage devices. Database theo-ries and systems have influenced the world for forty years (Bachman, 1969).  Especially, the Relational Database Model and systems have achieved a great success (Codd, 1970).  the Relational Database Model uses relational tables to describe basic relations between data types. the Relational Database Model's normal form theory ensures the correctness of data operations. 
Both the file system and the database system are invented at the age of mainframe and centralized computing. 
The World Wide Web is a huge decentralized file system.  There is no central control for adding, updating and removing Web pages.  The man-agement of the Web resources challenges traditional data models. 
Object-oriented databases and object-relational databases extend the application scope of the relational databases by borrowing the advantages of the object-oriented methodologies and programming languages like inheritance and encapsulation to model the real-world and Object-oriented databases and object-relational databases enable complex objects to be effectively managed (Kim, 1990; Rumbaugh et al., 1991; Mok, 2002).  But, Object-oriented databases and object-relational databases's limitations emerge in Web-based applications, which require resources to be managed in an open, decentralized, platform-irrelevant and content-based way. 
In data warehousing and OLAP area, the multi-dimensional data model was used. the multi-dimensional data model is suitable for storing large-scale historical data.  To support decision-making based on large data sets, data mining techniques are needed to discover the rules in large data sets (Han and Kambr, 2000). But, the multi-dimensional data model is limited in ability to meet the needs of resource management in the Internet environment where resources are complex and have to be frequently operated.  Compared with the relational data model, the multi-dimensional data model is weak in theory on data management. 
Fig. 1.1 depicts a file system on disk.  a file system on disk realizes the mapping from the directories and files of various type onto the disk space by establishing the index on the disk space. Users or up-level applications can operate files according to files's names and path regardless of files's physical storage. 
Fig. 1.2 shows the keyword index on the World Wide Web. the World Wide Web is actually a decentralized file system, which enables users to browse Web pages by Web pages's URLs.  Search engines establish indeces on Web pages distributed on the World Wide Web by collecting and classifying Web pages according to keywords and then recommending Web pages sharing the same set of keywords according to the page rank (S.Brin and L.Page, www7.scu.edu.au,1998). 
Comparison of the file system on disk and the file system on the World Wide Web implicates the evolution of file systems. 
With the development of Web applications, effective management of the contents of various resources on the Web becomes a challenge.  The new generation data model should be a semantic-rich model that is able to manage content rather than file name.  But to precisely describe the content of an individual resource is difficult and a formal description is not easy for sharing among people of different communities. The Resource Space Model can reflect the content of resources by classification semantics. 
People often use the classification method to manage various contents in daily life. For example, researchers are organized into research groups according to the research topics researchers are working on. Publishers classify Publishers's products (books, journals and conference proceedings) into different categories according to disciplines and contents. 
A set of resources can be classified by different classification methods as shown in the left hand of Fig. 1.3.  Multiple classification methods constitute a multi-dimensional semantic space over a set of resources as shown in the right hand of Fig. 1.3, where each axis represents a kind of classification method.  
The Resource Space Model is such a semantic space that manages information, knowledge and service resources. Information resources refer to various types of electronic files that can be transmitted through the Internet, and can be read or perceived directly or indirectly.  Knowledge resources include metadata, relation and strucuture as well as the abstract concepts, axioms, rules and methods that can be represented in a certain machine-understandable form.  Knowledge can be generated from understanding the information resources or generalizing human experience.  Service resources refer to the reusable capability processes for performing tasks, solving problems, or processing information or knowledge resources. 
A resource space can be presented in: 
1.	conceptual or logical aspect the definition of an n-dimensional re-source space; 
2.	user view aspect a subspace of the whole resource space displayed in user-understandable form; 
3.	representation aspect the cross-platform understandable definition based on standard description languages like XML, RDF and OWL; and,  
4.	storage aspect the physical storage of the resource space including the storage of the space structure, relevant index and resource enti-ties. 
The characteristics of the Resource Space Model require a specific method to help design resource spaces.  Before presenting a specific method to help design resource spaces, we first introduce the basic notion and components of the Resource Space Model.
