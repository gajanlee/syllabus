The result of a point query is a set of points, each of which contains a set of resources with membership probability. For a resource space RS, the point query operation is used to select the desirable points according to a given restriction. This type of query can be denoted as p(RS)={p | pRS  Fp(p)}, where Fp is a logic expression. The basic form of Fp is: pm[Xi]  Y, where Y may be pn[Xj] or just a noun phase in domain ontology, pm and pn are points and represents =, , <, ,  or >. Fp is usually a logical combination of basic forms by using ,  and . 
The probabilistic Resource Space Model uses the following SQL-like ROL statement to support point queries. The conditional expression in the following SQL-like ROL statement is the logical combination of restrictions on the projec-tions on axes of points. SELECT POINT p FROM RS(X1, … Xn) [WHERE <conditional expression>] 
Take Fig. 9.3 as an example, if the user wants to query all resources in points p1(a2, b1) and p2(a2, b2), the logical expression should be p(RS)={p | pRS  p[A]=a2  (p[B]=b1  p[B]=b2} and the issued point query statement should be: SELECT POINT p FROM RS(A, B) WHERE p[A]=a2 AND (p[B]=b1 OR p[B]=b2) 
Thus, the points p1(a2, b1) and p2(a2, b2) will be returned with resources and the points p1(a2, b1) and p2(a2, b2)'s membership probabilities belonging to the points p1(a2, b1) and p2(a2, b2).
