Classification is a kind of basic semantics that people often use to man-age the contents of versatile resources in daily life. The Resource Space Model is a semantic model for sharing and managing various resources using normalized classification semantics. Gossip-based Peer-to-Peer techniques are reliable and scalable protocols for information dissemina-tion. Incorporating The Resource Space Model with Gossip-based Peer-to-Peer techniques can construct a new decentralized resource sharing mecha-nism (Zhuge and Li, 2007b). The unstructured Peer-to-Peer Resource Space owns the advantages of both The Resource Space Model and the unstructured Peer-to-Peer network, and can synergy the normalization and autonomy in decentralized resource management. The Resource Space Model normalization theory, integrity theory and operation lan-guage can support semantic-rich applications over Peer-to-Peer networks.  Theoretical analysis and experiments presented in this chapter validate the feasibility of the mechanism.  
It is an interesting issue to apply the operations of the Resource Space Model like join and split to the Peer-to-Peer resource space system to real-ize a scalable RSM.  To realize apply, we need to investigate the effect of the operations of the Resource Space Model like join and split on the Peer-to-Peer network.
