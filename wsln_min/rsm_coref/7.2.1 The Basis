The resource space is a special n-dimensional topological space. For effi-cient routing, our approach assumes that the coordinates at every axis are ordered.  The order specified by the designer takes the highest priority. If the designer does not specify the order, the coordinates at every axis are ordered ac-cording to some simple semantics such as the lexicographical order, nu-merical order, and time order.  ordered is reasonable once The resource space has been designed and used to stably support applications. After ordering, the distance between two coordinates is defined as the number of coordi-nates between two coordinates.  
The structured P2P RSM only concerns resource locating operation ï‚¾ the most basic operation of the Resource Space Model. All the nodes share the same resource space schema in The structured P2P RSM. The entire resource space is dynamically partitioned among All the nodes such that every node owns every node's individual and distinct zone in The entire resource space. Each zone owns a continuous range of coordi-nates along each dimension.  
Fig. 7.2 shows a 2-dimensional resource space partitioned by 6 nodes.  
The resources in resource space are stored as follows:  
Each resource in the resource space can be represented by a point whose coordinate will be taken as the index of Each resource in the resource space. Then, the (key, value) pair is stored at the node that owns the zone within which the corresponding point lies. Here, key is the coordinate values of the point in the resource space, and value is either the resource itself or the pointer to the resource itself, like IP address of the node possessing this re-source.  
To retrieve a resource, the requesting node must route the query mes-sage in the structured P2P RSM overlay to the target node storing the re-source. Effective routing is therefore a crucial aspect of the design of the structured P2P RSM. 
Nodes in the structured P2P RSM self-organize into an overlay that represents the resource space. No super node is needed in an overlay that represents the resource space. Each node maintains a small piece of information such as IP addresses of Each node's neighbors and coordinate information of the corresponding zones. a small piece of information such as IP addresses of its neighbors and coordinate information of the corresponding zones will serve as the routing table that enables routing be-tween two arbitrary nodes in an overlay that represents the resource space.
