Because the number of points N in resource space is fixed, the distribu-tion of coordinates on axes indicates the possible case of the number of coordinates on every axis when the number of points N in resource space is given. For example, if the number of points N is 8 and the dimension of space is 3, according to  , then all the possible distributions of coordinates on axes are: (1, 2, 4), (1, 1, 8) and (2, 2, 2). We can see that the distribution (1, 1, 8) is the most uneven, almost all of coordinates locate on only one axis. The distribu-tion (2, 2, 2) is the most even, the number of coordinates on every axis is equal. Then from the perspective of searching complexity, which case of distribution is better? The following will answer this question.
