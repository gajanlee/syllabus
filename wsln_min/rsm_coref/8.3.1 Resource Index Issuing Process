When a resource index is issued by one peer, one peer first decides the category a resource index belongs to by utilizing the partition information of the resource space.  A limit l restricting the whole process should be set.  Along with each hop the message has transferred, A limit l restricting the whole process will be reduced by one. Then one peer forms an issuing message including a resource index in-dex, and sends an issuing message including the resource in-dex to one of the peers in that category through one peer's level views.  When a peer receives an issuing message including the resource in-dex, a peer first decides wheth-er to add a resource index to a peer's maintaining repository in consideration of a peer's capacity.  If its capacity exceeds its capacity's upper limit, then a peer randomly selects one neighbor from a peer's proper level view and disseminates the issuing mes-sage. The issuing process will proceed until a resource index is accepted or A limit l restricting the whole process reaches zero.  When A limit l restricting the whole process is zero, one peer also joins the community to which a resource index belongs to manage the resources.
