The probabilistic event in the Probabilistic Resource Space Model is that a resource belongs to a certain class. Prob(rT) denotes the membership probability of resource r belonging to class T. class T. may represent a class of resources of a resource space, an axis, a coordinate, a point or any of their combination by set operations. 
The following are two strategies on how to specify the probabilistic dis-tribution of a given resource r belonging to a resource space RS. 
1.	For any resource r, specify any resource r's membership probability distribution on every point of any resource r. 
2.	For each axis X of RS, specify the membership probability distribution of any resource r on every coordinate of X. 
The second strategy is more feasible because of the following reasons: 
1.	The amount of points in resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) is |X1||X2|…|Xn| and the amount of coordinates is |X1|+|X2|+…+|Xn|, where |X| is the number of coordinates on X.  Large number of points makes it difficult to assign the membership probability of eve-ry resource to every point. 
2.	Each axis in a resource space represents a resource classification method. For a point p(Ci1, Ci2, …, Cin), Cij is at axis Xj (1jn), and R(p)=R(Ci1)R(Ci2)…Cin). a point p(Ci1, Ci2, …, Cin) is a combination of all axes of RS and involves all classification methods used in resource space.  It is more feasible for users and automatic classification algo-rithms to specify the membership probability distribution of resource r by axis. 
Definition 9.1. The resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) is a probabilistic re-source space if for any resource r and any axis Xi of The resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn), there exists a membership probability function ri from any axis Xi of RS to the real number interval [0, 1] such that ri(Cij) represents the probability of any resource r belonging to class R(Cij) for any top-level coordinate Cij at any axis Xi of RS. 
According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic re-source space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) has n membership probabilistic functions. Take the probabilistic resource space RS(A, B) in Fig. 9.1 for example, re-source r has two membership probabilistic functions, r-A: A[0, 1] and r-B: B[0, 1]. r-B(b1)=0.2 means that the probability of re-source r be-longing to coordinate b1 is 0.2 at axis B.  
Resource r belongs to resource space RS(X1, X2, … , Xn) if and only if there exists at least one axis Xi such that the membership probabilistic function of Resource r on at least one axis Xi has been explicitly specified. 
    From the membership probabilities on the coordinates, the membership probabilities on other classes in the classification hierarchy can be evaluated as follows:  
1.	For axis Xi={Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim}, since R(Xi)=R(Ci1)R(Ci2)…R(Cim), the probability of r belonging to axis Xi={Ci1, Ci2, …, Cim} falls into the interval [max{ri(Ci1), …, ri(Cim)}, min{1, ri(Ci1)+ ri(Ci2)+…+ri(Cim)}]. 
2.	For point p(C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn), since R(p) = R(C1,j1)  R(C2,j2)  …  R(Cn,jn), the probability of r belonging to point p(C1,j1, C2,j2, …, Cn,jn) falls into the interval [0, min{r1(C1,j1), …, rn(Cn,jn)}]. 
3.	For a hierarchical coordinate, the probability of r belonging to a co-ordinate C’ in the hierarchy depends on the probability that r be-longs to r's parent C, i.e., ri(C’) = Prob(rR(C’) | rR(C)). Since C’ is a child coordinate of its parent C, Prob(rR(C’)) = Prob(rR(C’)  rR(C)) holds. According to Prob(rR(C’)rR(C)) = Prob(rR(C))  Prob(rR(C’) | rR(C)), we have Prob(rR(C’)) = ri(C)  ri(C’). So the probability of r belonging to R(C’) is ri(C)  ri(C’). 
Take Fig. 9.1 for example, the probability of resource r belonging to axis A is Prob(rR(A))[max{r-A(a1), r-A(a2), r-A(a3)}, min{1, r-A(a1)+r-A(a2)+r-A(a3)}]=[0.3, 0.6]. The probability of resource r belong-ing to point p(a2, b2) is Prob(rR(p(a2, b2)))  [0, min{r-A(a2), r-B(b2)}] = [0, 0.3]. 
  In Fig. 9.2, the axis Area is used to classify scientific publications according to scientific publications's area. In the classification hierarchy of coordinate CS (Computer Science) on the axis Area, DB (DataBase) is a sub-class of coordinate CS (Computer Science) and RDB (Relational DataBase) is a sub-class of DB (DataBase). For resource r and resource r's membership probability function r, r(RDB) represents the conditional probability of resource r belonging to RDB (Relational DataBase) given resource r belonging to DB (DataBase) has occurred, i.e. r(RDB)=Prob(rR(RDB)|rR(DB)). Similarly, r(DB)= Prob(rR(DB)|rR(CS)). Since DB (DataBase) is a sub-class of coordinate CS (Computer Science), the probability of resource r belonging to DB (DataBase) is Prob(rR(DB)) = Prob(rR(DB)rR(CS)) = Prob(rR(CS))  Prob(rR(DB)|rR(CS)) = r(CS)  r(DB). In fact, the probability of resource r belonging to a sub-coordinate is the multiplication of all the conditional probabilities along the path from the top-level coordinate to a sub-coordinate. So the probability of resource r belonging to RDB (Relational DataBase) is r(CS)  r(DB)  r(RDB).
