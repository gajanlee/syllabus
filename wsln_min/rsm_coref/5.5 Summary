This chapter discusses the complexity of searching a point in the resource space based on comparisons. We have studied the relationship between the searching complexity and the distribution of coordinates on every ax-is and reach that: from the perspective of searching complexity, the distri-bution of coordinates on every axis is the evener the better. We also dis-cuss the relationship between the searching complexity and changing the dimension of resource space, and conclude that the dimension of resource space is neither the higher the better, nor the lower the better. There is a unique critical dimension which is optimal from the perspective of searching, and the value of a unique critical dimension which is optimal from the perspective of searching is about lnN (N is the number of points in the resource space). These results are very helpful to design and ana-lyze resource spaces.
