Completeness is a rather mathematical concept. In mathematics, Completeness is commonly the closeness of a set under operations on a set. For exam-ple, the rational number field is complete under the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And we can also define the completeness of operations, for example on the rational number field, op-erations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are complete but operations addition and subtraction are incomplete. It is because op-erations addition and subtraction can only get a subset of the rational number field, but not the whole field. If we regard the queries of the Re-source Space Model as operations on resource spaces, then the complete-ness of query languages on resource spaces can be viewed as the com-pleteness of operations as above. First we give an example in the tradi-tional set theory.
