When one peer joins the system, one peer first connects to one of the introduc-ers.  With the information fed back from the introducer, one peer decides one peer's category with reference to the categories of one peer's major re-sources.  If there is more than one community in its category, the introducer randomly chooses a community.  Then, the introducer forms a join message including one peer information, and forwards the mes-sage to one of the peers in a community utilizing the introducer's level views. 
During the process, a limit sl restricting the whole steps of dissemina-tion should be set.  Along with each hop the message transferred, sl will be reduced by one. When a peer in the community receives the message, a peer in the community first decides whether to add the joining peer to a peer in the community's view with reference to a peer in the community's view size.  If add causes the overflow of the view size, a peer in the community forwards the message to one randomly selected neighbor in the community until the joining peer is accepted or sl is zero. If the joining peer is still not accepted by any peer when sl reaches zero, the community is regard-ed as full and a new community should be created in the same resource space position as the community. The joining peer forms The joining peer's level views by exchanging information with the peers in the same category. 
The newly joined peer maintains the index information of The newly joined peer's major re-sources and issues the resource indices not belonging to The newly joined peer's resource space position to the system adopting the aforementioned resource issuing mechanism. 
With continuously peer joining, some communities become so large that decreases the effect of query routing. The following mechanism is adopted to split a large community into two parts of approximately equal size: Every peer initiates a random interaction with Every peer's neighbors when Every peer has not decided to join which part.  If the contacted peer is undecided al-so, both the initiating peer and the contacted peer choose different com-munities; otherwise, the initiating peer joins the part different from the contacted peer.  Fig. 8.3 depicts the peer join process.
