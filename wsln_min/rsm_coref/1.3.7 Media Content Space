A four-dimensional Dunhuang cave content space can be designed by classifying the cave content according to the following four axes: dynasty, artifact type (wall painting, color statue, calligraphy), media type (text, video, image) and cave number as shown in Fig. 1.13.  The dynasty axis can be classified by the following sequential coordinates: Tang, Song, Yu-an, Ming, and Qing. Any coordinate can be refined, for example, the Tang dynasty can be further divided into three sequential stages: early, middle and late.  Given a set of coordinates on every axis, a set of contents can be accurately located.
