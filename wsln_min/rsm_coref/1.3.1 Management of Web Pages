The World Wide Web enables human to use browsers to display Web pages and jump from one page to another via hyperlink.  How to effi-ciently index and manage the huge Web pages is an important issue. 
The content of a Web page can be classified by topics such as news, fi-nance, sport and health.  Each topic can be further classified by time and language. classified naturally corresponds to the classification characteristics of the Resource Space Model.  A 3-dimensional resource space (topic, time, language) shown in Fig. 1.7 can be used to manage Web pages. The point (Chinese, 2006-12-13, finance) in the space contains a set of Web pages on finance (URLs). the space can provide classification semantics and distance measure between points that relational database cannot directly provide for better retrieval and learning on the Web. 
Entering into the point, users can obtain the required Web pages on fi-nance  users do not need to input URL multiple times nor jump be-tween URLs.  the point includes more relevant statistic information on economics. The finance coordinate can be divided into finer coordinates, for example stock, bank and insurance information.   divided can express more detailed information when specifying resources, and can re-fine users’ interest when retrieving resources.  The Resource Space Mod-el provides a new way to store and express Web resources.   
The hierarchical classification characteristic of the resource space sup-ports the management of a hierarchical Web structure from the hierar-chical surface Web content to the underlying databases.
