Each node maintains a routing table that holds the IP addresses and the virtual coordinate zones of Each node's neighbors in the resource space. In an n-dimensional resource space, two nodes are neighbors if two nodes's coordinate zones overlap at n1 dimensions and adjoin at one dimension. In Fig. 7.2, node 3 is a neighbor of node 1 because node 3's coordinate zone overlaps with the node 1’s at the X-axis and adjoins at the Y-axis. Node 6 is not a neighbor of node 1 because their coordinate zones do not adjoin at both the X and Y axes. 
The zone of each node is an n-dimensional rectangle and can be de-noted by R. R = (R0, R1, …, Rn-1)	(7.1) 
Here, n is the number of dimensions and Rk is a closed interval [a, b] describing the scope of the zone along dimension k. 
The size of the routing table is very small, i.e. O(n) for a n-dimensional resource space. No special effort is needed to well design the structure of the routing table. The speed of searching the routing table is fast.
