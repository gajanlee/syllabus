The query result of a resource query is a set of resources, each of which satisfies the specified restrictions on membership probabilities. This type of query can be represented as r(RS) = {r | rRS Ù Tp(RS) Ù Fr(r, T)}, where Fr is a logic expression and p(RS) is a point query result. The basic form of Fr is Prob(rÎT)Y, where Y may be a real number or a real number interval. If Y is a real number,  is or.  If Y is a re-al number interval,  isÎ or Ï 
The probabilistic Resource Space Model uses the following statement to support resource queries.  SELECT RESOURCE r FROM RS(X1, … Xn) [WHERE <conditional expression>] 
The <conditional expression> in this statement is a logical expression combination of restrictions on membership probabilities. The <conditional expression> in this statement takes the following form: Prob(r)Y IN point-query-sub-expression, where Prob(r)Y has the same meanings as mentioned above and point-query-sub-expression is a point query statement returning a set of points. So Prob(r)Y IN point-query-sub-expression represents a logical expression that Y and the probability of resource r belonging to point-query-sub-expression satisfies the relation  
For example in Fig. 9.4, if the user wants to query all resources which belong to point p(a2, b2) with the probability greater than 0.5, the corre-sponding logical expression is F(RS)={r | rRS  T={p | pRS  p[A]=a2  p[B]=b2} Prob(rT)>0.5} and the issued resource query statement should be: SELECT RESOURCE r FROM RS(A, B) WHERE Prob(r)>0.5 IN (SELECT POINT p FROM RS(A, B) WHERE p[A]=a2 AND p[B]=b1) 
Thus, all resources belonging to point p(a2, b2) with the probability greater than 0.5 will be returned to users.
