Some characteristics of expressiveness of operations are given as follows. 
Characteristic 3.1 Given two operation sets OPs and OPt, it is possible that neither OPs>OPt nor OPs<OPt holds. 
For example, for RSS={RS1, RS2}, OPs={} and OPt={}, we have RSSOPs ={RS1, RS2, RS1RS2} and RSSOPt ={RS1, RS2, RS1RS2}. So RSSOPs RSSOPt and RSSOPt  RSSOPs, then both OPs={>OPt and OPs<OPt do not hold, i.e., we cannot say which one is stronger than the other in expressiveness. 
Characteristic 3.2 Given two different operation sets {OPs} and {OPt}, the expressiveness of two different operation sets {OPs} and {OPt} can be the same. 
For example, for RSS={RS1 , RS2}, OPs={È, -} and OPt={È, -, Ç}, we have RSSOPs ={, RS1- RS2, RS2 RS2, RS2- RS1, RS1, RS1RS2, RS2, RS1∪RS2}=RSSOPt, so the expressiveness of them are the same. 
Characteristic 3.3 Given two operation sets OPs and OPt, if OPsOPt then OPs>OPt. 
Characteristic 3.4 If OPs>OPt and OPr>OPs, then OPr>OPt. 
Characteristic 3.5 Given an operation set OPs, if an operation set OPs is equivalent to or can be represented by some operations in an operation set OPs, then an operation set OPs>an operation set OPs. 
Characteristic 3.6 If OPs>OPt, then (OPsOPt)=OPs. 
Characteristic 3.6 tells that if newly defined operations can be repre-sented by existing operations, then the expressiveness of operations does not increase in essence.
