To define a view of a resource space, the name of a view of a resource space as well as the query that computes a view of a resource space is required.  a view of a resource space can be defined by the following command, where <query expression> is any valid query expression.  The view name is represented by v. CREATE  VIEW  v  AS  <query expression> 
As an example, consider the view consisting of m axes of a resource space.  We can define view RS–view as follows: CREATE  view RS–view  AS SELECT FROM  RS 
The list of axis names can be omitted.  We define a view over two re-source spaces by using the merge operation as follows, where the new ax-is axism is formed by . CREATE VIEW  RS–view (axis1, …, axism)  AS SELECT   FROM  RS1 the merge operation SELECT    FROM  RS2 WHERE  X1 = Y1, …, Xm-1=Ym-1 AND  Xm.axis_name = Ym.axis_name. 
We can define a view combining two resource spaces by joining the subspaces selected from two resource spaces as follows: CREATE  VIEW  RS–view (axis1, …, axism)  AS SELECT    FROM  RS1 JOIN SELECT    FROM  RS2 WHERE  X1 = Y1, …, Xi = Yi  (iminimum(m,n))
