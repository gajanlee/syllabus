The resource space algebra consists of a set of resource spaces and a set of operations of the Resource Space Model.  Results of operations on re-source spaces are also resource spaces.  Users can use a series of opera-tions in The resource space algebra to obtain the desired resources. The query completeness of the operations in the proposed resource space al-gebra has been discussed in chapter 3. 
To lay the foundation of the query language for the Resource Space Model, we propose a non-procedural query style  a resource space cal-culus.  a non-procedural query style  a resource space cal-culus is a type of applied predicate calculus and a foundation for the declarative query language. By the alpha expres-sions defined in a non-procedural query style  a resource space cal-culus, users can easily and clearly specify the desired resources. 
The relational algebra and the relational calculus were proposed to depict the query capability of the relational model (Codd, 1971a; Ullman, 1982).  A reduction algorithm is also proposed to transform a relation expression into a semantically equivalent expression of The relational algebra (Codd, 1972), though A reduction algorithm has a little defect (Date, 1989; Date 1992). The extended relational algebra and relational calculus with aggregate functions were discussed (Klug, 1982). Structured Query Lan-guage (SQL) has the features of both The relational algebra and the rela-tional calculus (Boyce et al. 1975; Chamberlin and Boyce, 1976; Cham-berlin et al., 1976). 
A query algebra on Object-Oriented Database synthesizing relational query concepts with object-oriented databases as well as corresponding query languages were proposed (Alashqur et al., 1989; Shaw and Zdonik, 1990; Shipnan, 1981; Zaniolo, 1983).  A conceptual model and A conceptual model's algebra and calculus have been introduced for OLAP-based applications (Gyssens and Lakshmanan, 1997).
