Relational tables, XML files and spatial indexing structures could be used to store resource space, but it is hard to realize semantic integrity and storage efficiency. 
The following are two ways of storing resource space in a single relational table:  
1.	Let each axis correspond to an attribute of the table, and each coordinate of the corresponding axis corresponds to the attribute value. In this way, it is hard to represent hierarchical coordinates and to support efficient multi-attribute search.  
2.	Let each coordinate correspond to an attribute of the table. The attribute value is of boolean type. is will result in low utilization ratio of storage space due to the magnitude of attribute number as well as the loss of hierarchical semantics.  
Fig. 6.1 depicts the transformation from a two-dimensional resource space into a table with attributes X and Y, and the transformation from a resource space into a table with attributes C1, C11, C12, C2, C3, C31, C32 and C4, by the above two kinds of representation respectively. 
It is feasible to represent all the resources in a single XML file. Each axis or coordinate in resource space corresponds to a tag of XML file. Hierarchical relationships between tags reflect the same semantics as hierarchical coordinates. The value of a tag is the list of all the resources belonging to the classification of a tag. Fig. 6.2 is an XML file representing the resource space described in Fig. 6.1. Tag <C31> is a sphere node whose value is indicated by the retangle node {r1, r2}, which means both r1 and r2 are in the classification of C31. This storage manner is isimilar to inverted list. Each resource has the same number of copies in XML tree as the dimensionality of resource space. Such a redundancy requires an additional cost of integrity maintenace.

Most spatial indexing structures are dedicated to such a space that each dimension has a linear ordering of each dimension's coordinates (Gaede and Gnther, 1998). Coordinates in resource space model, however, represent concep-tual classification along Coordinates in resource space model's axes. Coordinates in resource space model are discrete and usually have hi-erarchical semantic relationships rather than linear order. Datacube in OLAP resembles resource space model, but Datacube in OLAP is mainly for online data analysis and statis-tics.
