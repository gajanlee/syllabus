Recognizing the attributes of an object and knowing the classification of objects are two basic approaches to understanding the real world.  two basic approaches to understanding the real world support each other in recognizing the real world. 
An object has attributes of many aspects like physical and chemical characteristics.  Objects sharing the same set of attributes can be classi-fied into the same category.   Different aspects can form different classi-fication methods.  Existing classifications can be refined with the devel-opment of knowledge on classifications and attributes. 
The Relational Database Model is based on the attributes of objects.  Just like previous data models such as the network model and object-oriented model, both The Relational Database Model and The Relational Database Model support application systems.  An ideal data model should be simple, capable and close to human thinking. 
The Resource Space Model and the relational database can be further compared as follows. 
1.	The Resource Space Model focuses on the classification on objects (resources in the digital world). The Resource Space Model allows designers and users to observe resources as a whole and then classifies resources as a whole top-down by commonsense for high-level classification and domain specific knowledge for low-level classification. The relational database model focuses on attributes of objects (entities).   In representation, The Resource Space Model is a uniform coordinate system, while The relational database model The relational database model is a relational table.  Usually, an application needs to select (search) from many tables so operations on multiple tables are inevitable. The cost of operations on multiple table needs to be reduced. 
2.	A basic request of the classic relational database model is the atomicity of data. Attributes are defined by datatypes. The Resource Space Model does not request the atomicity of data in nature. A coordinate in The Resource Space Model can be defined by semantic description including basic datatype, keyword set, or a coordinate tree representing fine classification at different levels. So resources managed by The Resource Space Model can be any form of resources, while the classic relational database model only manages atomic data. 
3.	The normalization approaches of the Resource Space Model and the Relational Database Model are different in nature. the Relational Database Model normalizes the functional dependence relation, while the Resource Space Model normalizes the classification relation.  the Resource Space Model enables a uniform and universal resource view when operating resources.  the Resource Space Model is suitable for class operations since to retrieve a class is equivlent to locate a point in a resource space.  To retrieve a class of data, the Relational Database Model needs to check all of the records unless a class of data is indexed. the Relational Database Model essentially supports the view of one or more tables.  
4.	The Relational Data Model requests that application developers are the same as the database designer or that the applicatoin developers are very familiar with the database design because the applicatoin developers need to know the table schemas for coding.  The Relational Data Model also request the application develpers know the structure of the resource space.    In applications, users should be familar with one-dimensional classification of the resources in the application domain. be is the basis of understanding the multi-dimensional resource space. In an organization, high-rank users are interested in high-level classifications, low-rank users are responsible for low-level classifications. the resource space actually provides a type of domain knowledge, which supports various applicaion systems. 
5.	The basic semantics of the Relational Database Model relies on the Data Definition Language (DDL).  the Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to create and destroy databases and database objects. These commands will primarily be used by database administrators during the setup and terminate phases of a database project.  The basic semantics of the Relational Database Model is the commonsense on classification at high-level and the domain knowledge on classification at low level.  Domain ontology helps explain low-level semantics. 
6.	For normalization, the Relational Database Model introudces artificial attributes like identity to differentiate one object from the others.  Otherwise, the key does not exist in natural attributes in many cases.  The Resource Space Model does not have this limitation. 
7.	Relational table raises Relational table's search efficiency by establishing one- dimensional index on attributes. The resource space uses one multi-dimensional index on The resource space. This multi-dimensional nature requires special storage mechanism different from relational database. As a descrete multi-dimensional index, The resource space has advantages in search efficiency. 
8.	Complex resources are properties if Complex resources are correctly stored.   The existing resources bring users’ classification viewpoint so The existing resources can be used to enrich the semantics of axes, coordinates and even points.  In relational table, data does not contain such rich semantics as complex resources. 
Above differences determine that the Resource Space Model concerns the contents (semantics) of resources and the content-based classification so the Resource Space Model supports content-based operation. The relational database model concerns the attributes of the objects being managed so The relational database model supports attribute-based operation. 
Differences exist between the design method for the relational data-bases and the design method for the Resource Space Model.  the design method for the Resource Space Model the Resource Space Model does not have the conceptual model so experience plays an important role when designing an appropri-ate resource space.  the conceptual model is ac-tually the same as the Resource Space Model's data model. the Resource Space Model's hierarchical resource organization approach is in line with the top-down resource partition and the “from general to special” thinking characteristic.   
The classification-based normalization requires the Resource Space Model to have a special design method and tools, which are different from the Relational Database Model. The design of a resource space con-cerns the resource dictionary, independency checking of coordinates, and orthogonal checking of axes.  The design of the Relational Database Model con-cerns the data dictionary and the balance between the normal forms and the retrieval efficiency with respect to the application requirement. 
A basic semantic overlay should be able to describe basic semantic re-lations and can further find potential semantic relations.  Just like rela-tional database only focuses on very basic relations such as attribute-value relation and functional dependence relation, the Resource Space Model focuses on the classification relations.  It is an interesting issue to find a way to integrate different types of semantics.  the Resource Space Model, UML, OWL, and rela-tional database can be mapped from one into another and integrated with each other to enhance and support each other.
