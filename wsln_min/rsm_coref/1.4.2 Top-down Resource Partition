Yin-Yang is a representative of traditional Chinese understanding of  how things are formed and work. Yin represents the following abstract concepts generalized from the real world: dark, passive, downward, cold, contracting and weak, while Yang represents the following abstract concepts generalized from the real world: bright, active, upward, hot, expanding and strong. Yin-Yang Yang represent two energies that cause everything to happen. Yin-Yang Yang are meta concepts in ancient Chinese philosophy. 
Different epistemologies have different meta concepts. 
Due to the difference of epistemology and culture, designers could have different partition solutions on the same set of resources, so a uniform viewpoint on resource partition is needed. The first step is to reach a top-level partition consensus.   
Human, information and natural (or artificial) object can be the resource partition of human society at the epistemological level.  The top-level resource partition of a domain is a special case of the epistemological level, for example, the top-level resources of an institute can be classified as three independent categories:  
1.	human resources,  
2.	information resources, and  
3.	service resources (including facilitates). 
Each category can be refined until the categories are small enough for applications as shown in Fig.1.15. (Zhuge, 2004b).
