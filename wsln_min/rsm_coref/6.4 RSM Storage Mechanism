To achieve the semantic goal, we devise a RSM schema tree to encode all hierarchy semantics of a given RSM in a single binary tree. a RSM schema tree to encode all hierarchy semantics of a given RSM in a single binary tree provides three basic functions as follows:  
1.	void createStorageSpace(RS rs)it accepts a RSM schema as input and creates an underlying physical storage space, a multidimensional bit string space. 
2.	BitString normalize(Concept c) it accepts a concept as input, and returns a concept's path in the schema tree as a bit string. RSM schema tree plays the role of mapping RSM and resource operations at the logical level into those at the physical level. 
3.	BitString normalize(Axis a) it accepts an axis as input, and returns an axis's path in the schema tree as a bit string. 
To achieve the operation goal, we devise C-tree to index the underly-ing multidimensional bit string space. C-tree to index the underly-ing multidimensional bit string space provides the following four basic functions: 
1.	ResourceSet exactQuery(Classification c)  ResourceSet exactQuery(Classification c finds out all the resources belonging to the input conceptual classification. Each conceptual classification is a point in the multidimensional bit string space. 
2.	Boolean insert(Resource r) it inserts the given resource in C-tree. the given resource contains the given resource's conceptual classification as well as location.  
3.	Boolean delete(Resource r) it deletes the given resource from C-tree.  
4.	ResourceSet rangeQuery(ClassificationRange range) it returns all the resources whose conceptual classifications are inside the given conceptual classification range.  
C-tree puts nearby classification points together in external memory so as to achieve an amortized cost of O(logN + T) where N is the number of resources and T is the number of retrieved resources.
