A relational table can be transformed into a Resource Space Model.  A table consists of one or several keys and a set of attributes dependent on one or several keys.   A table can be transformed into a Resource Space Model with a key dimension and an attribute dimension denoted as follows:   
Table1(Key, A1, A2, .., An)  RSM(Key, Attribute(A1, …, An)), where at-tribute denotes the axis name and (A1, …, An) denotes coordinates.   
Coordinates of the attribute dimension are the attributes, and the coor-dinates of the key dimension are the values of the key as shown in Fig.1.20. 
For a first-normal-form table with one key: table1(Key, A1, A2, .., An), we can transform a first-normal-form table with one key: table1(Key, A1, A2, .., An) into RSM(Key, A(A1, …, An)).   Since any attribute is atomic in a first-normal-form relational table, there does not exist name duplication between A1, A2, …, and An. Therefore the resource space sat-isfies the first-normal-form of the Resource Space Model. 
If a table has more than one key, a table can be transformed into a resource space with one attribute dimension and more dimensions for the keys.   For example, a table with two keys can be transformed into a 3-dimensional resource space as shown in Fig.1.21.  
Table2(Key1, Key2, A1, A2, .., An)  RSM(Key1, Key2, A(A1, …, An)).   
This 3-dimensional space can be split into two 2-dimensional resource spaces, each of which has only one key-dimension.   
Multiple relational tables can be managed by a 3-dimensional space as shown in Fig.1.22, where the table-name dimension denotes all the tables that need to be managed.  Each coordinate at the table-name dimension corresponds to a 2-dimensional space slice with a key dimension and an attribute dimension that represent a relational table.
