Theorem 5.4. Given a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and every Xi's coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. Suppose N is the number of points in space and |Xi| is the number of coordinates on ax-is Xi, and the space dimension n and every |Xi| are all variable. Let f(n) be the Min W(n) in theorem 5.2, then there exists a unique critical dimen-sion n0 (1< n0 < lgN ), such that if n<n0, f(n) decreases according to the increase of n; if n>n0, f(n) increases according to the increase of n. 
Proof. When the space dimension n is fixed, according to theorem 5.2, f(n)=Min W(n)= . Then we study the properties of f(n) ac-cording to the changing of dimension n. Let f(x)= , x is real and 1 x  lgN, then we only need to study the properties of f(n), then discuss x's values on integers. The differential of f(x) is: 
Then f (1)=1.5+N(1lnN)<0 and f (lgN) = >0. It is obvious that f (lgN) is continuous, so according to the median theorem of continuous functions [G. Strang, Calculus, Wellesley-Cambridge, 1991], there exits a zero point of f (lgN) between 1 and lgN. Then we can get the differential of f (lgN) again: 
It is obvious that f (x)>0, then f(x) is a concave function and f (x)>0 is strictly increasing, so the zero point of f (x)>0 between 1 and lgN is unique. Let the zero point of f (x) between 1 and lgN be Z, since f(x) is concave, we can get that f(Z) is the minimum of f(x) between 1 and lgN, and when x<Z, f(x) is strictly de-creasing, when x>Z, f(x) is strictly increasing. If Z is an integer, let n0=Z. If Z is not an integer and , let n0= , else let n0= . Then we have that n0 is the unique minimum point of f(n), and if n<n0, f(n) decreases with the increasing of n; if n>n0, f(n) increases with the in-creasing of n.  
Theorem 5.4 shows that from the perspective of searching complexity, the space dimension is not the higher the better, and is not the lower the better either. There is a unique critical dimension, at first the searching complexity in the worst case decreases according to the increasing of space dimension, when space dimension reaches a unique critical dimension, the searching complexity in the worst case increases according to the in-creasing of space dimension, i.e., the searching complexity in the worst case is the least when the space dimension is a unique critical dimension. 
In the case of the most uneven distribution of coordinates on every ax-is, we have the following corollary: 
Corollary 5.4. Given a class of resource spaces RS(X1, X2, …, Xn), where every Xi and every Xi's coordinates are unsorted in alphabet, 1in. Suppose N is the number of points in space and |Xi| is the number of coordinates at ax-is Xi, and the space dimension n and every |Xi| are all variable. Let F(n) be the Max W(n) in theorem 5.3, then F(n) increases according to the in-creasing of n.
