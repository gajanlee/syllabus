The Resource Space Model’s Join, Disjoin, Merge and Split operations can also be applied to the Resource Class Hierarchy. The following theo-rem defines the Join operation on resource class hierarchies of resource spaces: 
Theorem 2.4. Let RS1(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm) and RS2(Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn) be two resource spaces that can be joined together to form the resource space RS(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn). Assume that RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are the resource class hierarchies of RS1(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm and E2 respectively. We construct the directed graph RSG(CS, E) such that: 
(1) CS = X1*  X2*  …  Xn*  {(1, …, i-1, i, i+1, …, n) | 1 in}; 
(2) For any two classes c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) and c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in CS, <c, c>  E holds if and only if both <(C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm), (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm)>  E1 and <(Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn), (Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E2 hold. 
Then, the directed graph RSG(CS, E) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS. 
Proof. According to the definition 2.8, it is obvious that CS is the re-source class set of resource space RS. We will prove that E satisfies the last two conditions mentioned in definition 2.9. 
(1) For any two resource classes c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) and c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in CS, if <c, c>  E holds, then <(C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm), (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm)>  E1 and < (Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn), (Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E2 hold. Since RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are the resource class hier-archies of RS1 and RS2 respectively, R(C1)  R(C1), R(C2)  R(C2), …, R(Cn)  R(Cn) hold. So c c c holds. 
(2) For any two resource classes c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) and c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in CS, if c c c holds, we can prove that there exists one path from c to Cn in RSG(CS, E). Clearly, both (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) c (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) and (Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) c (Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) hold. Let xi (t+1im) be a coordinate from the axis Xi (t+1im). And this coordi-nate satisfies: R(Ci)  R(xi)  R(Ci) and there does not exist a coordinate xi such that both R(xi)  R(xi)  R(Ci) and xi  xi hold. Thus, both <( C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm), (C1, …, Ct, xt+1, …, xm)>  E1 and <(Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn), (xt+1, …, xm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E2 hold. So <c, (C1, …, Ct, xt+1, …, xm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E holds. By analogy, through limited steps we can construct one path from c to Cn in RSG(CS, E). 
According to 1) and 2), we can conclude that the directed graph RSG(CS, E) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS.  
According to theorem 2.4, the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS deriving from the Join operation of resource spaces RS1 and RS2 can be easily constructed. 
The Disjoin operation on the resource class hierarchy of a given re-source space complies with the following theorem. 
Theorem 2.5. Let RS1(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm) and RS2(Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn) be two resource spaces which derive from the Disjoin opera-tion on the resource space RS(X1, …, Xt, Xt+1, …, Xm, Xm+1, …, Xn). As-sume that RSG(CS, E) is the resource class hierarchy of RS. We con-struct the directed graph RSG1(CS1, E1) such that: 
(1) CS1 = X1*  X2*  …  Xm*  {(1, …, i-1, i, i+1, …, m) | 1 im}; 
(2) For any two resource classes c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) and c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in CS1, <c, c>  E1 holds if and only if there exists at least a pair of resource classes (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) and (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in RSG(CS, E) such that <(C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn), (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E1 holds. 
Then, the directed graph RSG1(CS1, E1) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS1. 
Proof. We prove that RSG1(CS1, E1) satisfies the three conditions as the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS1 as follows: 
(1) According to the definition of the resource class set of a given re-source space, it is obvious that CS1 is the resource class set of resource space RS1. 
(2) For any two resource classes c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) and c = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in CS1, if <c, c>  E1 holds, then there exists one pair of resource classes (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) and (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn) in RSG(CS, E) such that <(C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn), (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm, Cm+1, …, Cn)>  E holds. Thus, R(C1)  R(C1), R(C2)  R(C2), …, R(Cm )  R(Cm) hold. It is obvious that c c c holds. 
(3) Suppose that two resource classes c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) and c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in CS1 satisfy c1 c c1. There exist two re-source classes c and c in CS such that two re-source classes c and c in CS have common coordinates on X1, X2, …, and Xm with two resource classes c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) respectively and c c c holds. So there must exist one path (c, v1, v2, …, vp, c) connecting c with c in RSG(CS, E). For any vi (1ip), there must exist a class vi in CS1 such that a class vi in CS1 has common coordinates on X1, X2, …, Xm with a class vi in CS1. Thus, there must exist the path (c1, v1, v2, …, vp, c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm)) connecting c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) with c1 = (C1, …, Ct, Ct+1, …, Cm) in RSG1(CS1, E1). 
According to 1), 2) and 3), we have: the directed graph RSG1(CS1, E1) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS1.  
Theorem 2.5 provides a method to obtain the resource class hierarchy of a resource space deriving from the Disjoin operation on another re-source space. 
The following theorem defines the Merge operation on resource class hierarchies of resource spaces: 
Theorem 2.6. Let RS1(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) and RS2(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) be two resource spaces that can be merged into a resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) by merging X and X into X. Assume that RSG1(CS1, E1) and RSG2(CS2, E2) are the resource class hierarchies of X and X E2 re-spectively and that ac, ac and ac are the axis resource classes corre-sponding to axes X, X and X respectively. We construct the directed graph RSG(CS, E) that satisfies: 
1.	CS¬ = CS1  CS2  {ac} – {ac, ac}; and, 
2.	E = E1  E2  {<ac, c> | <ac, c>  E1 or <ac, c>  E2}  {<c, ac> | <c, ac>  E1 or <c, ac>  E2} – {<ac, c> | <ac, c>  E1} – {<ac, c> | <ac, c>  E2}. 
If RS is in 2NF, then the directed graph RSG(CS, E) is the resource class hierarchy of RS. 
Proof. Let CS* be the resource class set of RS. 
(1) Assume that the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬ holds. If the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬ equals to either ac or the base resource class of RS, then c  CS¬* holds. Otherwise, either c  CS1 or c  CS2 holds. Thus the coordi-nate C is on either X or X. So we conclude that the coordinate also be-longs to X. It is obvious that the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬  CS¬*. So CS  CS¬* holds. For any re-source class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬*, If any re-source class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬* is equal to either ac or the base resource class of RSRS, then c  CS¬ holds. Otherwise, the coordi-nate C must be on X. Thus the coordinate is on either X or X. So either c  CS1 or c  CS2 holds. It is obvious that c  CS¬. So CS*  CS¬ holds. Thus, we have CS = CS* holds. So CS = CS* is the resource class set of RS. (1) Assume that the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬ holds. If the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬ equals to either ac or the base resource class of RS, then c  CS¬* holds. Otherwise, either c  CS1 or c  CS2 holds. Thus the coordi-nate C is on either X or X. So we conclude that the coordinate also be-longs to X. It is obvious that the resource class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬  CS¬*. So CS  CS¬* holds. For any re-source class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬*, If any re-source class c = (C1,i1, C2, i2, …, Cm,im, C)  CS¬* is equal to either ac or the base resource class of RSRS, then c  CS¬ holds. Otherwise, the coordi-nate C must be on X. Thus the coordinate is on either X or X. So either c  CS1 or c  CS2 holds. It is obvious that c  CS¬. So CS*  CS¬ holds. Thus, we have CS = CS* holds. So CS = CS* is the resource class set of RS. 
(2) It is easy to prove that for any <c, c>  E, c c c holds. For any two resource classes c and c in RS that satisfy c c c, we will prove that there exists one path from c to c in RSG(CS, E) (here excludes the case where c is equal to c): (a) Firstly, we suppose that c  CS1 holds. If c is equal to ac, then we can conclude that c c c holds. So there must exist one path (ac, v1, v2, …, vp, c) from ac to c in RSG1(CS1, E1). Thus, one path (ac, v1, v2, …, vp, c) from ac to c in RSG1(CS1, E1) must exist in RSG(CS, E). If c is not equal to ac, c  CS1 must hold. Otherwise, the RS arising from the merge of RS and RS2 cannot be in 2NF. So there must exist a path (c, v1, v2, …, vp, c) from c to c in RSG1(CS1, E1). There must exist a path  from c to c in RSG(CS, E) which is obtained by replacing ac with ac in (c, v1, v2, …, vp, c). (b) Similarly, we can draw the same conclusion when c  CS1 holds. 
According to 1) and 2), we can conclude that the directed graph RSG(CS, E) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS.  
The Split operation on the resource class hierarchy of a given resource space complies with the following theorem. 
Theorem 2.7. Let RS1(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) and RS2(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) be two resource spaces deriving from the Split operation on the resource space RS(X1, X2, …, Xm, X) in 2NF. Assume that RSG(CS, E) is the re-source class hierarchy of RS and that ac, ac and ac are the axis resource classes of axes X, X and X respectively. We construct the directed graph RSG1(CS1, E1) satisfying: 
1.	CS1 = X1*  X2*  …  Xm*  X*  {(1, …, i-1, i, i+1, …, m, ) | 1 im}  ac; and, 
2.	E1 = {<c, c> | cCS1  cCS1  <c, c>E}  {<ac, c> | cCS1  <ac, c>E}  {<c, ac> | cCS1  <c, ac>E}. 
Then, the directed graph RSG1(CS1, E1) is the resource class hierarchy of resource space RS1.
