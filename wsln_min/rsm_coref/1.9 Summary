Like Yin-Yang in ancient Chinese philosophy, normalization and auton-omy are two aspects of an ideal organization model. The Resource Space Model represents the normalization.  The Semantic Link Network repre-sents the autonomy.  Integration of The Resource Space Model and The Semantic Link Network can form a semantic overlay with the character-istics of normalization and autonomy. 
A Resource Space Model can be distributed onto a network to meet the needs of distributed applications. The method and technology of the dis-tributed databases are good references in developing the distributed Re-source Space Model.  
The Resource Space Model can be deployed onto a peer-to-peer net-work in a certain manner for decentralized applications.  The Resource Space Model is a way to realize the synergy of normalization and autonomy. 
The storage of the resource space is to map the resource space into a multi-dimensional index on a linear storage space by using a specific index structure.  The peer-to-peer com-puting can be regarded as a decentralized storage mechanism that distrib-utes a linear disk space onto a network.  
This book arranges This book's content as follows: 
Chapter 1 presents the general methodology of the Resource Space Model. Readers can know its general idea, concept, characteristic and method of the Resource Space Model.  Readers could understand and start to design resource spaces for applications after reading Chapter 1. 
Chapter 2 investigates the relationship between the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network, and proposes an approach to in-tegrate the Resource Space Model and the Semantic Link Network to construct a richer semantic overlay synergying the normalization and autonomy for managing resources in the future in-terconnection environment. 
Chapter 3 studies the expressiveness of query languages for Resource Space Model and introduces the completeness and necessity theory for query operations on resource spaces. 
Chapter 4 introduces the algebra and calculus theory for the Resource Space Model.  the algebra and calculus theory for the Resource Space Model are important parts of the theory of the Resource Space Model and the basis of the Resource Space Model's query language. 
Chapter 5 analyzes the complexity of searching in the resource space. Chapter 5 Chapter 5 unveils the relationship between the searching efficiency and the num-ber of dimensions as well as the relationship between the searching effi-ciency and the distribution of coordinates. 
Chapter 6 introduces an approach to physically store the resource space and the resource space's resources.  an approach to physically store the resource space and its resources should reflect the characteristics of the resource space and efficiently support flexible query. 
The next two chapters are on a decentralized Resource Space Model. Chapter 7 presents an approach to deploy a decentralized Resource Space Model onto peer-to-peer network to obtain the scalability. Chapter 8 presents an ap-proach to make use of classification semantics to improve the efficiency of unstructured peer-to-peer network. 
Chapter 9 constructs the probabilistic Resource Space Model to deal with uncertainty in applications by introducing the probability into the Resource Space Model. The motivation is similar to the fuzzy Resource Space Model (Zhuge, 2004c). the probabilistic Resource Space Model can be regarded as a more general Resource Space Model.
